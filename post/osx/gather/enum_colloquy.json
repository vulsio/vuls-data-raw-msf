	"description": "This module will collect Colloquy's info plist file and chat logs from the\n          victim's machine.  There are three actions you may choose:  INFO, CHATS, and\n          ALL.  Please note that the CHAT action may take a long time depending on the\n          victim machine, therefore we suggest to set the regex 'PATTERN' option in order\n          to search for certain log names (which consists of the contact's name, and a\n          timestamp).  The default 'PATTERN' is configured as \"^alien\" as an example\n          to search for any chat logs associated with the name \"alien\".",
