	"description": "This module will read the first line of a file based on an error message from ansible-playbook with sudo privileges.\n          ansible-playbook takes a yaml file as input, and if there is an error, such as a non-yaml file, it outputs the line\n          where the error occurs. This can be exploited to read the first line of the file, which we'll typically want to read\n          /etc/shadow to obtain root's hash.",
