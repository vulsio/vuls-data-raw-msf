  "description": "Grab secrets and keys from the vCenter server and add them to\n          loot. This module is tested against the vCenter appliance only;\n          it will not work on Windows vCenter instances. It is intended to\n          be run after successfully acquiring root access on a vCenter\n          appliance and is useful for penetrating further into the\n          environment following a vCenter exploit that results in a root\n          shell.\n\n          Secrets include the dcAccountDN and dcAccountPassword for\n          the vCenter machine which can be used for maniuplating the SSO\n          domain via standard LDAP interface; good for plugging into the\n          vmware_vcenter_vmdir_ldap module or for adding new SSO admin\n          users. The MACHINE_SSL, VMCA_ROOT and SSO IdP certificates with\n          associated private keys are also plundered and can be used to\n          sign forged SAML assertions for the /ui admin interface.",
