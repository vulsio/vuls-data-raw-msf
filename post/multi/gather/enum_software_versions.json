  "description": "This module, when run against a compromised machine, will gather details on all installed software,\n          including their versions and if available, when they were installed, and will save it into a loot file for later use.\n          Users can then use this loot file to determine what additional vulnerabilites may affect the target machine.\n\n          Note that for Linux systems, software enumeration is done via package managers. As a result the results may\n          not reflect all of the available software on the system simply because users may have installed additional\n          software from alternative sources such as source code that these package managers are not aware of.",
