  "description": "Post Module to dump the password hashes for Android System. Root is required.\n            To perform this operation, two things are needed.  First, a password.key file\n            is required as this contains the hash but no salt.  Next, a sqlite3 database\n            is needed (with supporting files) to pull the salt from.  Combined, this\n            creates the hash we need.  Samsung based devices change the hash slightly.",
