  "description": "This module will inject a specified reflective DLL into the memory of a\n          process, new or existing. If arguments are specified, they are passed to\n          the DllMain entry point as the lpvReserved (3rd) parameter. To read\n          output from the injected process, set PID to zero and WAIT to non-zero.\n          Make sure the architecture of the DLL matches the target process.",
