  "description": "This module provides a PXE server, running a DHCP and TFTP server.\n        The default configuration loads a linux kernel and initrd into memory that\n        reads the hard drive; placing a payload to install metsvc, disable the\n        firewall, and add a new user metasploit on any Windows partition seen,\n        and add a uid 0 user with username and password metasploit to any linux\n        partition seen. The windows user will have the password p@SSw0rd!123456\n        (in case of complexity requirements) and will be added to the administrators\n        group.\n\n        See exploit/windows/misc/pxesploit for a version to deliver a specific payload.\n\n        Note: the displayed IP address of a target is the address this DHCP server\n        handed out, not the \"normal\" IP address the host uses.",
