	"description": "This module will enumerate user accounts in the default Active Domain (AD) directory and stores\n          them in the database. If GROUP_MEMBER is set to the DN of a group, this will list the members of\n          that group by performing a recursive/nested search (i.e. it will list users who are members of\n          groups that are members of groups that are members of groups (etc) which eventually include the\n          target group DN.",
