	"description": "This module will enumerate AD groups on the specified domain which are specifically managed.\n          It cannot at the moment identify whether the 'Manager can update membership list' option\n          option set; if so, it would allow that member to update the contents of that group. This\n          could either be used as a persistence mechanism (for example, set your user as the 'Domain\n          Admins' group manager) or could be used to detect privilege escalation opportunities\n          without having domain admin privileges.",
