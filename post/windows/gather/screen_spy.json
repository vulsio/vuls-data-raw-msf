This\n          allows for screen spying which can be useful to determine if there is an active\n          user on a machine, or to record the screen for later data extraction.\n\n          Note: As of March, 2014, the VIEW_CMD option has been removed in\n          favor of the Boolean VIEW_SCREENSHOTS option, which will control if (but\n          not how) the collected screenshots will be viewed from the Metasploit\n          interface.",
