  "description": "This module finds saved login credentials\n          for the Windows Skype client. The hash is in MD5 format\n          that uses the username, a static string \"\\nskyper\\n\" and the\n          password. The resulting MD5 is stored in the Config.xml file\n          for the user after being XOR'd against a key generated by applying\n          2 SHA1 hashes of \"salt\" data which is stored in ProtectedStorage\n          using the Windows API CryptProtectData against the MD5",
