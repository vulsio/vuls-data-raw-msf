	"description": "Due to mismanagement of SAM and SYSTEM hives in Windows 10, it is possible for an unprivileged\n          user to read those files. But, as they are locked while Windows is running we are not able\n          to read them directly. The trick is to take advantage of Volume Shadow Copy, which is generally\n          enabled, to finally have a read access. Once SAM and SYSTEM files are successfully dumped and\n          stored in `store_loot`, you can dump the hashes with some external scripts like secretsdump.py",
