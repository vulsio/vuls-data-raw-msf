	"description": "This module will determine if SecureCRT is installed on the target system and, if it is, it will try to\n          dump all saved session information from the target. The passwords for these saved sessions will then be decrypted\n          where possible, using the decryption information that HyperSine reverse engineered.\n\n          Note that whilst SecureCRT has installers for Linux, Mac and Windows, this module presently only works on Windows.",
