  "description": "This module exports and decrypts credentials from SolarWinds Orion Network\n          Performance Monitor (NPM) to a CSV file; it is intended as a post-exploitation\n          module for Windows hosts with SolarWinds Orion NPM installed. The module\n          supports decryption of AES-256, RSA, and XMLSEC secrets. Separate actions for\n          extraction and decryption of the data are provided to allow session migration\n          during execution in order to log in to the SQL database using SSPI. Tested on\n          the 2020 version of SolarWinds Orion NPM. This module is possible only because\n          of the source code and technical information published by Rob Fuller and\n          Atredis Partners.",
