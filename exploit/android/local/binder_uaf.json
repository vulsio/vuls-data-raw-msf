	"description": "This module exploits CVE-2019-2215, which is a use-after-free in Binder in the\n            Android kernel. The bug is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that\n            allows for a full compromise of a vulnerable device. If chained with a browser\n            renderer exploit, this bug could fully compromise a device through a malicious\n            website.\n            The freed memory is replaced with an iovec structure in order to leak a pointer\n            to the task_struct. Finally the bug is triggered again in order to overwrite\n            the addr_limit, making all memory (including kernel memory) accessible as part\n            of the user-space memory range in our process and allowing arbitrary reading\n            and writing of kernel memory.",
