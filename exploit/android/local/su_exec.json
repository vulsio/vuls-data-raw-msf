	"description": "This module uses the su binary present on rooted devices to run\n          a payload as root.\n\n          A rooted Android device will contain a su binary (often linked with\n          an application) that allows the user to run commands as root.\n          This module will use the su binary to execute a command stager\n          as root. The command stager will write a payload binary to a\n          temporary directory, make it executable, execute it in the background,\n          and finally delete the executable.\n\n          On most devices the su binary will pop-up a prompt on the device\n          asking the user for permission.",
