	"description": "This module gains a session with root permissions on versions of OS X with\n        sudo binary vulnerable to CVE-2013-1775. Tested working on Mac OS 10.7-10.8.4,\n        and possibly lower versions.\n\n        If your session belongs to a user with Administrative Privileges\n        (the user is in the sudoers file and is in the \"admin group\"), and the\n        user has ever run the \"sudo\" command, it is possible to become the super\n        user by running `sudo -k` and then resetting the system clock to 01-01-1970.\n\n        This module will fail silently if the user is not an admin, if the user has never\n        run the sudo command, or if the admin has locked the Date/Time preferences.\n\n        Note: If the user has locked the Date/Time preferences, requests to overwrite\n        the system clock will be ignored, and the module will silently fail. However,\n        if the \"Require an administrator password to access locked preferences\" setting\n        is not enabled, the Date/Time preferences are often unlocked every time the admin\n        logs in, so you can install persistence and wait for a chance later.",
