	"description": "This module provides a persistent boot payload by creating a launch item, which can be\n          a LaunchAgent or a LaunchDaemon. LaunchAgents run with user level permissions and are triggered\n          upon login by a plist entry in ~/Library/LaunchAgents. LaunchDaemons run with\n          elevated privilleges, and are launched before user login by a plist entry in the ~/Library/LaunchDaemons directory.\n          In either case the plist entry specifies an executable that will be run before or at login.",
