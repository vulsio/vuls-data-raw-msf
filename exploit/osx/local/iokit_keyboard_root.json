  "description": "A heap overflow in IOHIKeyboardMapper::parseKeyMapping allows kernel memory\n        corruption in Mac OS X before 10.10. By abusing a bug in the IORegistry, kernel\n        pointers can also be leaked, allowing a full kASLR bypass.\n\n        Tested on Mavericks 10.9.5, and should work on previous versions.\n\n        The issue was patched silently in Yosemite.",
