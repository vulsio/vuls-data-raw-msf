	"description": "This exploits an improper use of setuid binaries within VMware Fusion 10.1.3 - 11.5.3.\n          The Open VMware USB Arbitrator Service can be launched outide of its standard path\n          which allows loading of an attacker controlled binary.  By creating a payload in the\n          user home directory in a specific folder, and creating a hard link to the 'Open VMware\n          USB Arbitrator Service' binary, we're able to launch it temporarily to start our payload\n          with an effective UID of 0.\n          @jeffball55 discovered an incomplete patch in 11.5.3 with a TOCTOU race.\n          Successfully tested against 10.1.6, 11.5.1, 11.5.2, and 11.5.3.",
