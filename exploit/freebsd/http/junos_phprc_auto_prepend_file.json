  "description": "This module exploits a PHP environment variable manipulation vulnerability affecting Juniper SRX firewalls\n          and EX switches. The affected Juniper devices run FreeBSD and every FreeBSD process can access their stdin\n          by opening /dev/fd/0. The exploit also makes use of two useful PHP features. The first being\n          'auto_prepend_file' which causes the provided file to be added using the 'require' function. The second PHP\n          function is 'allow_url_include' which allows the use of URL-aware fopen wrappers. By enabling\n          allow_url_include, the exploit can use any protocol wrapper with auto_prepend_file. The module then uses\n          data:// to provide a file inline which includes the base64 encoded PHP payload.\n\n          By default this exploit returns a session confined to a FreeBSD jail with limited functionality. There is a\n          datastore option 'JAIL_BREAK', that when set to true, will steal the necessary tokens from a user authenticated\n          to the J-Web application, in order to overwrite the the root password hash. If there is no user\n          authenticated to the J-Web application this method will not work. The module then authenticates\n          with the new root password over SSH and then rewrites the original root password hash to /etc/master.passwd.",
