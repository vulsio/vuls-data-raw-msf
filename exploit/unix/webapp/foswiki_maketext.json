  "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in the MAKETEXT Foswiki variable. By using\n        a specially crafted MAKETEXT, a malicious user can execute shell commands since the\n        input is passed to the Perl \"eval\" command without first being sanitized. The\n        problem is caused by an underlying security issue in the CPAN:Locale::Maketext\n        module.  Only Foswiki sites that have user interface localization enabled\n        (UserInterfaceInternationalisation variable set) are vulnerable.\n\n          If USERNAME and PASSWORD aren't provided, anonymous access will be tried.\n        Also, if the FoswikiPage option isn't provided, the module will try to create a\n        random page on the SandBox space. The modules has been tested successfully on\n        Foswiki 1.1.5 as distributed with the official Foswiki-1.1.5-vmware image.",
