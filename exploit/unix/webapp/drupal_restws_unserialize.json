	"description": "This module exploits a PHP unserialize() vulnerability in Drupal RESTful\n        Web Services by sending a crafted request to the /node REST endpoint.\n\n        As per SA-CORE-2019-003, the initial remediation was to disable POST,\n        PATCH, and PUT, but Ambionics discovered that GET was also vulnerable\n        (albeit cached). Cached nodes can be exploited only once.\n\n        Drupal updated SA-CORE-2019-003 with PSA-2019-02-22 to notify users of\n        this alternate vector.\n\n        Drupal < 8.5.11 and < 8.6.10 are vulnerable.",
