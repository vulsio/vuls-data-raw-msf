  "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin's setup\n        feature which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP\n        code into a configuration file. The original advisory says\n        the vulnerability is present in phpMyAdmin versions 2.11.x\n        < 2.11.9.5 and 3.x < 3.1.3.1; this module was tested on\n        3.0.1.1.\n\n        The file where our payload is written\n        (phpMyAdmin/config/config.inc.php) is not directly used by\n        the system, so it may be a good idea to either delete it or\n        copy the running config (phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php) over it\n        after successful exploitation.",
