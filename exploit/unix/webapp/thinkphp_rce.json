  "description": "This module exploits one of two PHP injection vulnerabilities in the\n          ThinkPHP web framework to execute code as the web user.\n\n          Versions up to and including 5.0.23 are exploitable, though 5.0.23 is\n          vulnerable to a separate vulnerability. The module will automatically\n          attempt to detect the version of the software.\n\n          Tested against versions 5.0.20 and 5.0.23 as can be found on Vulhub.",
