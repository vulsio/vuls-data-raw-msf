  "description": "WP Mobile Detector Plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that allows a remote attacker\n          to execute arbitrary PHP code. This flaw exists because the\n          /wp-content/plugins/wp-mobile-detector/resize.php script does contains a\n          remote file include for files not cached by the system already.\n          By uploading a .php file, the remote system will\n          place the file in a user-accessible path. Making a direct request to the\n          uploaded file will allow the attacker to execute the script with the privileges\n          of the web server.",
