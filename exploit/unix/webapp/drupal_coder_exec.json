  "description": "This module exploits a Remote Command Execution vulnerability in the\n        Drupal CODER Module. Unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary\n        commands under the context of the web server user.\n\n        The CODER module doesn't sufficiently validate user inputs in a script\n        file that has the PHP extension. A malicious unauthenticated user can\n        make requests directly to this file to execute arbitrary commands.\n        The module does not need to be enabled for this to be exploited.\n\n        This module was tested against CODER 2.5 with Drupal 7.5 installed on\n        Ubuntu Server.",
