	"description": "WP Symposium Plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that allows a remote attacker\n          to execute arbitrary PHP code. This flaw exists because the\n          /wp-symposium/server/file_upload_form.php script does not properly verify or\n          sanitize user-uploaded files. By uploading a .php file, the remote system will\n          place the file in a user-accessible path. Making a direct request to the\n          uploaded file will allow the attacker to execute the script with the privileges\n          of the web server.",
