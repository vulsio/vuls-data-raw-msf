  "description": "The Wordpress plugin \"MailPoet Newsletters\" (wysija-newsletters) before 2.6.8\n          is vulnerable to an unauthenticated file upload. The exploit uses the Upload Theme\n          functionality to upload a zip file containing the payload. The plugin uses the\n          admin_init hook, which is also executed for unauthenticated users when accessing\n          a specific URL. The first fix for this vulnerability appeared in version 2.6.7,\n          but the fix can be bypassed. In PHP's default configuration,\n          a POST variable overwrites a GET variable in the $_REQUEST array. The plugin\n          uses $_REQUEST to check for access rights. By setting the POST parameter to\n          something not beginning with 'wysija_', the check is bypassed. Wordpress uses\n          the $_GET array to determine the page, so it is not affected by this. The developers\n          applied the fixes to all previous versions too.",
