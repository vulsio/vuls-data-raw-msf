	"description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in the JCE component for Joomla!, which\n      could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to upload arbitrary files, caused by the\n      fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input. Sending specially-crafted HTTP\n      request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to upload a malicious PHP\n      script, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable\n      system. This module has been tested successfully on the JCE Editor 1.5.71 and Joomla\n      1.5.26.",
