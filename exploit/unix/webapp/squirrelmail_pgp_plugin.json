This flaw was found while quickly\n        grepping the code after release of some information at\n        http://www.wslabi.com/. Later, iDefense published an advisory ....\n\n        Reading an email in SquirrelMail with the PGP plugin activated\n        is enough to compromise the underlying server.\n\n        Only \"cmd/unix/generic\" payloads were tested.",
