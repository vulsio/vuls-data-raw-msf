  "description": "This module exploits two arbitrary PHP code execution flaws in the\n        phpBB forum system. The problem is that the 'highlight' parameter\n        in the 'viewtopic.php' script is not verified properly and will\n        allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code via preg_replace().\n\n        This vulnerability was introduced in revision 3076, and finally\n        fixed in revision 5166. According to the \"tags\" within their tree,\n        this corresponds to versions 2.0.4 through 2.0.15 (inclusive).",
