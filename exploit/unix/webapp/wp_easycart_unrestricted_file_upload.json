	"description": "WordPress Shopping Cart (WP EasyCart) Plugin for\n                              WordPress contains a flaw that allows a remote\n                              attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This\n                              flaw exists because the\n                              /inc/amfphp/administration/banneruploaderscript.php\n                              script does not properly verify or sanitize\n                              user-uploaded files. By uploading a .php file,\n                              the remote system will place the file in a\n                              user-accessible path. Making a direct request to\n                              the uploaded file will allow the attacker to\n                              execute the script with the privileges of the web\n                              server.\n\n                              In versions <= 3.0.8 authentication can be done by\n                              using the WordPress credentials of a user with any\n                              role. In later versions, a valid EasyCart admin\n                              password will be required that is in use by any\n                              admin user. A default installation of EasyCart will\n                              setup a user called \"demouser\" with a preset password\n                              of \"demouser\".",
