	"description": "This module exploits a shellshock vulnerability on Qmail, a public\n        domain MTA written in C that runs on Unix systems.\n        Due to the lack of validation on the MAIL FROM field, it is possible to\n        execute shell code on a system with a vulnerable BASH (Shellshock).\n        This flaw works on the latest Qmail versions (qmail-1.03 and\n        netqmail-1.06).\n        However, in order to execute code, /bin/sh has to be linked to bash\n        (usually default configuration) and a valid recipient must be set on the\n        RCPT TO field (usually admin@exampledomain.com).\n        The exploit does not work on the \"qmailrocks\" community version\n        as it ensures the MAILFROM field is well-formed.",
