	"description": "This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in\n        tnftp's handling of the resolved output filename - called \"savefile\" in\n        the source - from a requested resource.\n\n        If tnftp is executed without the -o command-line option, it will resolve\n        the output filename from the last component of the requested resource.\n\n        If the output filename begins with a \"|\" character, tnftp will pass the\n        fetched resource's output to the command directly following the \"|\"\n        character through the use of the popen() function.",
