  "description": "This module exploits an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the Web GUI of Syncovery File Sync & Backup Software for Linux.\n          Successful exploitation results in remote code execution under the context of the root user.\n\n          Syncovery allows an authenticated user to create jobs, which are executed before/after a profile is run.\n          Jobs can contain arbitrary system commands and will be executed as root.\n          A valid username and password or a session token is needed to exploit the vulnerability.\n          The profile and its log file will be deleted afterwards to disguise the attack.\n\n          The vulnerability is known to work on Linux platforms. All Syncovery versions prior to v9.48j are vulnerable including all versions of branch 8.",
