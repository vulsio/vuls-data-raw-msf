Use reverse payloads for the most\n          reliable results. Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability,\n          there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload.\n          Port binding payloads are disregarded due to the restrictive firewall settings.\n\n          This module has been tested successfully on VMTurbo Operations Manager versions 4.5 and\n          4.6.",
