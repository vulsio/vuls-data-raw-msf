  "description": "This module exploits a Clickjacking vulnerability in pfSense <= 2.4.1.\n\n          pfSense is a free and open source firewall and router. It was found that the\n          pfSense WebGUI is vulnerable to Clickjacking. By tricking an authenticated admin\n          into interacting with a specially crafted webpage it is possible for an attacker\n          to execute arbitrary code in the WebGUI. Since the WebGUI runs as the root user,\n          this will result in a full compromise of the pfSense instance.",
