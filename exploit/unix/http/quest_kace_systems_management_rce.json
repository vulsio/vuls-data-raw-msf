  "description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Quest KACE\n        Systems Management Appliance version 8.0.318 (and possibly prior).\n\n        The `download_agent_installer.php` file allows unauthenticated users\n        to execute arbitrary commands as the web server user `www`.\n\n        A valid Organization ID is required. The default value is `1`.\n\n        A valid Windows agent version number must also be provided. If file\n        sharing is enabled, the agent versions are available within the\n        `\\kace.local\\client\\agent_provisioning\\windows_platform` Samba share.\n        Additionally, various agent versions are listed on the KACE website.\n\n        This module has been tested successfully on Quest KACE Systems\n        Management Appliance K1000 version 8.0 (Build 8.0.318).",
