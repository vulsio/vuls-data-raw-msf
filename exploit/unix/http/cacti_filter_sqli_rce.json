An admin can exploit the filter\n          variable within color.php to pull arbitrary values as well as conduct stacked queries. With stacked queries, the\n          path_php_binary value is changed within the settings table to a payload, and an update is called to execute the payload.\n          After calling the payload, the value is reset.",
