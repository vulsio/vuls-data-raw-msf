  "description": "This exploits a command execution in Pi-Hole <= 4.4.  A new blocklist is added, and then an\n          update is forced (gravity) to pull in the blocklist content.  PHP content is then written\n          to a file within the webroot.  Phase 1 writes a sudo pihole command to launch teleporter,\n          effectively running a priv esc.  Phase 2 writes our payload to teleporter.php, overwriting,\n          the content.  Lastly, the phase 1 PHP file is called in the web root, which launches\n          our payload in teleporter.php with root privileges.",
