	"description": "This module exploits a Java deserialization vulnerability in the Inductive Automation Ignition SCADA product,\n          versions 8.0.0 to (and including) 8.0.7.\n          This exploit was tested on versions 8.0.0 and 8.0.7 on both Linux and Windows.\n          The default configuration is exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker, which can achieve\n          remote code execution as SYSTEM on a Windows installation and root on Linux.\n          The vulnerability was discovered and exploited at Pwn2Own Miami 2020 by the Flashback team (Pedro Ribeiro +\n          Radek Domanski).",
