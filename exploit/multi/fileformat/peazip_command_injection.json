  "description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in PeaZip. All\n        versions prior to 2.6.2 are suspected vulnerable. Testing was conducted with\n        version 2.6.1 on Windows.\n\n        In order for the command to be executed, an attacker must convince someone to\n        open a specially crafted zip file with PeaZip, and access the specially file via\n        double-clicking it. By doing so, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands\n        as the victim user.",
