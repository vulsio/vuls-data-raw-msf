  "description": "This module harnesses Maple's ability to create files and execute commands\n        automatically when opening a Maplet. All versions up to 13 are suspected\n        vulnerable. Testing was conducted with version 13 on Windows. Standard security\n        settings prevent code from running in a normal maple worksheet without user\n        interaction, but those setting do not prevent code in a Maplet from running.\n\n        In order for the payload to be executed, an attacker must convince someone to\n        open a specially modified .maplet file with Maple. By doing so, an attacker can\n        execute arbitrary code as the victim user.",
