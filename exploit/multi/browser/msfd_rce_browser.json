  "description": "Metasploit's msfd-service makes it possible to get a msfconsole-like\n      interface over a TCP socket. This module connects to the msfd-socket\n      through the victim's browser.\n\n      To execute msfconsole-commands in JavaScript from a web application,\n      this module places the payload in the POST-data. These POST-requests\n      can be sent cross-domain and can therefore be sent to localhost on the\n      victim's machine. The msfconsole-command to execute code is 'rbi -e\n      \"CODE\"'.\n\n      Exploitation when the browser is running on Windows is unreliable and\n      the exploit is only usable when IE is used and the quiet-flag has been\n      passed to msf-daemon.",
