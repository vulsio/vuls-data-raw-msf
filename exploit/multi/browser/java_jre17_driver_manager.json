  "description": "This module abuses the java.sql.DriverManager class where the toString() method\n        is called over user supplied classes from a doPrivileged block. The vulnerability\n        affects Java version 7u17 and earlier. This exploit bypasses click-to-play on Internet Explorer\n        and throws a specially crafted JNLP file. This bypass is applicable mainly to IE, where Java\n        Web Start can be launched automatically through the ActiveX control. Otherwise, the\n        applet is launched without click-to-play bypass.",
