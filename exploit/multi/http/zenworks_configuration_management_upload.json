	"description": "This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in Novell ZENworks Configuration\n        Management (ZCM, which is part of the ZENworks Suite). The vulnerability exists in\n        the UploadServlet which accepts unauthenticated file uploads and does not check the\n        \"uid\" parameter for directory traversal characters. This allows an attacker to write\n        anywhere in the file system, and can be abused to deploy a WAR file in the Tomcat\n        webapps directory. ZCM up to (and including) 11.3.1 is vulnerable to this attack.\n        This module has been tested successfully with ZCM 11.3.1 on Windows and Linux. Note\n        that this is a similar vulnerability to ZDI-10-078 / OSVDB-63412 which also has a\n        Metasploit exploit, but it abuses a different parameter of the same servlet.",
