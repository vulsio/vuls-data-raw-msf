	"description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the\n          Bricks Builder Theme versions <= 1.9.6 for WordPress. The vulnerability allows attackers\n          to execute arbitrary PHP code by leveraging a nonce leakage to bypass authentication and\n          exploit the eval() function usage within the theme. Successful exploitation allows for full\n          control of the affected WordPress site. It is recommended to upgrade to version 1.9.6.1 or higher.",
