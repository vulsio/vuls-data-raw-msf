	"description": "This module can be used to execute a payload on MoveableType (MT) that\n          exposes a CGI script, mt-upgrade.cgi (usually at /mt/mt-upgrade.cgi),\n          that is used during installation and updating of the platform.\n          The vulnerability arises due to the following properties:\n          1. This script may be invoked remotely without requiring authentication\n          to any MT instance.\n          2. Through a crafted POST request, it is possible to invoke particular\n          database migration functions (i.e. functions that bring the existing\n          database up-to-date with an updated codebase) by name and with\n          particular parameters.\n          3. A particular migration function, core_drop_meta_for_table, allows\n          a class parameter to be set which is used directly in a perl eval\n          statement, allowing perl code injection.",
