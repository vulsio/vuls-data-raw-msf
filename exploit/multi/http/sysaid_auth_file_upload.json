  "description": "This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in SysAid Help Desk.\n        The vulnerability exists in the ChangePhoto.jsp in the administrator portal,\n        which does not correctly handle directory traversal sequences and does not\n        enforce file extension restrictions. While an attacker needs an administrator\n        account in order to leverage this vulnerability, there is a related Metasploit\n        auxiliary module which can create this account under some circumstances.\n        This module has been tested in SysAid v14.4 in both Linux and Windows.",
