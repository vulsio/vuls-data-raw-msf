In LiteSpeed Cache versions prior to 6.5.0.1, when\n          the Debug Logging feature is enabled, the plugin will log admin cookies to the /wp-content/debug.log endpoint\n          which is accessible without authentication. The Debug Logging feature in the plugin is not enabled by default.\n          The admin cookies found in the debug.log can be used to upload and execute a malicious plugin containing a payload.",
