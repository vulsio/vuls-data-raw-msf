  "description": "This module exploits an improper input validation issue in Atlassian Confluence, allowing arbitrary HTTP\n          parameters to be translated into getter/setter sequences via the XWorks2 middleware and in turn allows for\n          Java objects to be modified at run time. The exploit will create a new administrator user and upload a\n          malicious plugins to get arbitrary code execution. All versions of Confluence between 8.0.0 through to 8.3.2,\n          8.4.0 through to 8.4.2, and 8.5.0 through to 8.5.1 are affected.",
