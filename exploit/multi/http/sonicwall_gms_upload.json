  "description": "This module exploits a code execution flaw in SonicWALL GMS. It exploits two\n        vulnerabilities in order to get its objective. An authentication bypass in the\n        Web Administration interface allows to abuse the \"appliance\" application and upload\n        an arbitrary payload embedded in a JSP. The module has been tested successfully on\n        SonicWALL GMS 6.0.6017 over Windows 2003 SP2 and SonicWALL GMS 6.0.6022 Virtual\n        Appliance (Linux). On the Virtual Appliance the linux meterpreter hasn't run\n        successfully while testing, shell payload has been used.",
