	"description": "A vulnerability exists within Mirth Connect due to its mishandling of deserialized data. This vulnerability\n          can be leveraged by an attacker using a crafted HTTP request to execute OS commands within the context of the\n          target application. The original vulnerability was identified by IHTeam and assigned CVE-2023-37679. Later,\n          researchers from Horizon3.ai determined the patch to be incomplete and published a gadget chain which bypassed\n          the deny list that the original had implemented. This second vulnerability was assigned CVE-2023-43208 and was\n          patched in Mirth Connect version 4.4.1. This module has been tested on versions 4.1.1, 4.3.0 and 4.4.0.",
