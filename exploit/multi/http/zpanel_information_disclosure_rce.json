  "description": "This module exploits an information disclosure vulnerability\n        in ZPanel. The vulnerability is due to a vulnerable version\n        of pChart used by ZPanel that allows unauthenticated users to read\n        arbitrary files remotely on the file system. This particular module\n        utilizes this vulnerability to identify the username/password\n        combination of the MySQL instance. With the\n        credentials the attackers can login to PHPMyAdmin and execute\n        SQL commands to drop a malicious payload on the filesystem and\n        call it leading to remote code execution.",
