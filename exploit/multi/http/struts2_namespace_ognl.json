	"description": "This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Struts\n        version 2.3 - 2.3.4, and 2.5 - 2.5.16. Remote Code Execution can be performed\n        via an endpoint that makes use of a redirect action.\n\n        Note that this exploit is dependant on the version of Tomcat running on\n        the target.  Versions of Tomcat starting with 7.0.88 currently don't\n        support payloads larger than ~7.5kb.  Windows Meterpreter sessions on\n        Tomcat >=7.0.88 are currently not supported.\n\n        Native payloads will be converted to executables and dropped in the\n        server's temp dir. If this fails, try a cmd/* payload, which won't\n        have to write to the disk.",
