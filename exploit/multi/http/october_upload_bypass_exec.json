Application prevents the user from\n          uploading PHP code by checking the file extension. It uses black-list based\n          approach, as seen in octobercms/vendor/october/rain/src/Filesystem/\n          Definitions.php:blockedExtensions().\n          This module was tested on October CMS version v1.0.412 on Ubuntu.",
