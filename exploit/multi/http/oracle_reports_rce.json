  "description": "This module uses two vulnerabilities in Oracle Forms and Reports to get remote code execution\n      on the host. The showenv url can be used to disclose information about a server. A second\n      vulnerability that allows arbitrary reading and writing to the host filesystem can then be\n      used to write a shell from a remote url to a known local path disclosed from the previous\n      vulnerability.\n\n      The local path being accessible from an URL allows an attacker to perform the remote code\n      execution using, for example, a .jsp shell.\n\n      This module was tested successfully on Windows and Oracle Forms and Reports 10.1.",
