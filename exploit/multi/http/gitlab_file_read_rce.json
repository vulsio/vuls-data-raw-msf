	"description": "This module provides remote code execution against GitLab Community\n          Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). It combines an arbitrary file\n          read to extract the Rails \"secret_key_base\", and gains remote code\n          execution with a deserialization vulnerability of a signed\n          'experimentation_subject_id' cookie that GitLab uses internally for A/B\n          testing.\n\n          Note that the arbitrary file read exists in GitLab EE/CE 8.5 and later,\n          and was fixed in 12.9.1, 12.8.8, and 12.7.8. However, the RCE only affects\n          versions 12.4.0 and above when the vulnerable `experimentation_subject_id`\n          cookie was introduced.\n\n          Tested on GitLab 12.8.1 and 12.4.0.",
