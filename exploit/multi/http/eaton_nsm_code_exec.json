  "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in Eaton Network Shutdown Module\n        version <= 3.21, in lib/dbtools.inc which uses unsanitized user input\n        inside a eval() call. Additionally the base64 encoded user credentials\n        are extracted from the database of the application. Please note that\n        in order to be able to steal credentials, the vulnerable service must\n        have at least one USV module (an entry in the \"nodes\" table in\n        mgedb.db)",
