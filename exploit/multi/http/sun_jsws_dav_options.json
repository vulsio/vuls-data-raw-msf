	"description": "This module exploits a buffer overflow in Sun Java Web Server prior to\n        version 7 Update 8. By sending an \"OPTIONS\" request with an overly long\n        path, attackers can execute arbitrary code. In order to reach the vulnerable\n        code, the attacker must also specify the path to a directory with WebDAV\n        enabled.\n\n        This exploit was tested and confirmed to work on Windows XP SP3 without DEP.\n        Versions for other platforms are vulnerable as well.\n\n        The vulnerability was originally discovered and disclosed by Evgeny Legerov of\n        Intevydis.",
