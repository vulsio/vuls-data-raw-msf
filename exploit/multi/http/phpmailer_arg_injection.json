	"description": "PHPMailer versions up to and including 5.2.19 are affected by a\n        vulnerability which can be leveraged by an attacker to write a file with\n        partially controlled contents to an arbitrary location through injection\n        of arguments that are passed to the sendmail binary. This module\n        writes a payload to the web root of the webserver before then executing\n        it with an HTTP request. The user running PHPMailer must have write\n        access to the specified WEB_ROOT directory and successful exploitation\n        can take a few minutes.",
