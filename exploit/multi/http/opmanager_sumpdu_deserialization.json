  "description": "An HTTP endpoint used by the Manage Engine OpManager Smart Update Manager component can be leveraged to\n          deserialize an arbitrary Java object. This can be abused by an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute OS\n          commands in the context of the OpManager application (NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM on Windows or root on Linux). This\n          vulnerability is also present in other products that are built on top of the OpManager application. This\n          vulnerability affects OpManager versions 12.1 - 12.5.328.\n\n          Automatic CVE selection only works for newer targets when the build number is present in the logon page. Due\n          to issues with the serialized payload this module is incompatible with versions prior to 12.3.238 despite them\n          technically being vulnerable.",
