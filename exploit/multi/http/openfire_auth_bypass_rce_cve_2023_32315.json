	"description": "Openfire is an XMPP server licensed under the Open Source Apache License.\n          Openfire's administrative console, a web-based application, was found to be vulnerable to a path traversal attack\n          via the setup environment. This permitted an unauthenticated user to use the unauthenticated Openfire Setup Environment\n          in an already configured Openfire environment to access restricted pages in the Openfire Admin Console reserved for\n          administrative users.\n          This module will use the vulnerability to create a new admin user that will be used to upload a Openfire management plugin\n          weaponised with java native payload that triggers an RCE.\n          This vulnerability affects all versions of Openfire that have been released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0.\n          The problem has been patched in Openfire release 4.7.5 and 4.6.8, and further improvements will be included in the\n          first version on the 4.8 branch, which is version 4.8.0.",
