  "description": "This module exploits an authenticated file upload remote code excution vulnerability\n          in PlaySMS Version 1.4. This issue is caused by improper file contents handling in\n          import.php (aka the Phonebook import feature). Authenticated Users can upload a CSV\n          file containing a malicious payload via vectors involving the User-Agent HTTP header\n          and PHP code in the User-Agent.\n          This module was tested against PlaySMS 1.4 on VulnHub's Dina 1.0 machine and Windows 7.",
