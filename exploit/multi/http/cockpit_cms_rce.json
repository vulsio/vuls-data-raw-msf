  "description": "This module exploits two NoSQLi vulnerabilities to retrieve the user list,\n          and password reset tokens from the system.  Next, the USER is targetted to\n          reset their password.\n          Then a command injection vulnerability is used to execute the payload.\n          While it is possible to upload a payload and execute it, the command injection\n          provides a no disk write method which is more stealthy.\n          Cockpit CMS 0.10.0 - 0.11.1, inclusive, contain all the necessary vulnerabilities\n          for exploitation.",
