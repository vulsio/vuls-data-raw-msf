  "description": "This module leverages a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in the OpenAM identity and\n          access management solution. The vulnerability arises from a Java deserialization flaw in OpenAMâ€™s\n          implementation of the Jato framework and can be triggered by a simple one-line GET or POST request to a\n          vulnerable endpoint. Successful exploitation yields code execution on the target system as the service user.\n\n          This vulnerability also affects the ForgeRock identity platform which is built on top of OpenAM and is thus\n          is susceptible to the same issue.",
