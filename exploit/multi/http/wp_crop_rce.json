	"description": "This module exploits a path traversal and a local file inclusion\n          vulnerability on WordPress versions 5.0.0 and <= 4.9.8.\n          The crop-image function allows a user, with at least author privileges,\n          to resize an image and perform a path traversal by changing the _wp_attached_file\n          reference during the upload. The second part of the exploit will include\n          this image in the current theme by changing the _wp_page_template attribute\n          when creating a post.\n\n          This exploit module only works for Unix-based systems currently.",
