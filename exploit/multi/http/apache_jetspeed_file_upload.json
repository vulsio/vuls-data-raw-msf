  "description": "This module exploits the unsecured User Manager REST API and a ZIP file\n        path traversal in Apache Jetspeed-2, version 2.3.0 and unknown earlier\n        versions, to upload and execute a shell.\n\n        Note: this exploit will create, use, and then delete a new admin user.\n\n        Warning: in testing, exploiting the file upload clobbered the web\n        interface beyond repair. No workaround has been found yet. Use this\n        module at your own risk. No check will be implemented.",
