A malicious entity can upload a PHP file into the\n          webroot without authentication, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\n          Although the vendor fixed Up.Time to prevent this vulnerability, it was not properly\n          mitigated. To exploit against a newer version of Up.Time (such as 7.4), please use\n          exploits/multi/http/uptime_file_upload_2.",
