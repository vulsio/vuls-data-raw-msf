	"description": "The GiveWP Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform for WordPress, in all versions up to and including 3.16.1,\n          is vulnerable to a PHP Object Injection (POI) attack that allows unauthenticated arbitrary code execution.\n          Although a patch was introduced in version 3.14.2, it was incorrect and can be bypassed.\n          This means the vulnerability remains exploitable in subsequent versions due to the ineffective patch.",
