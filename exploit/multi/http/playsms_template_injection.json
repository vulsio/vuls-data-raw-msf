  "description": "This module exploits a preauth Server-Side Template Injection vulnerability that leads to remote code execution\n          in PlaySMS before version 1.4.3. This issue is caused by double processing a server-side template with a custom\n          PHP template system called 'TPL' which is used in the PlaySMS template engine at\n          `src/Playsms/Tpl.php:_compile()`. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker supplied username with a\n          malicious payload is submitted. This malicious payload is then stored in a TPL template which when rendered a\n          second time, results in code execution.\n          The TPL(https://github.com/antonraharja/tpl) template language is vulnerable to PHP code injection.\n\n          This module was tested against PlaySMS 1.4 on HackTheBox's Forlic Machine.",
