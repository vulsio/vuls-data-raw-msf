	"description": "This module can be used to execute a payload on Lucee servers that have an exposed\n          administrative web interface. It's possible for an administrator to create a\n          scheduled job that queries a remote ColdFusion file, which is then downloaded and executed\n          when accessed. The payload is uploaded as a cfm file when queried by the target server. When executed,\n          the payload will run as the user specified during the Lucee installation. On Windows, this is a service account;\n          on Linux, it is either the root user or lucee.",
