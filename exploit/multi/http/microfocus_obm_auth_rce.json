  "description": "This module exploits an authenticated Java deserialization that affects a truckload of Micro\n          Focus products: Operations Bridge Manager, Application Performance Management, Data Center Automation,\n          Universal CMDB, Hybrid Cloud Management and Service Management Automation. However this module\n          was only tested on Operations Bridge Manager.\n          Exploiting this vulnerability will result in remote code execution as the root user on Linux or\n          the SYSTEM user on Windows.\n          Authentication is required, the module user needs to login to the application and obtain the\n          authenticated LWSSO_COOKIE_KEY, which should be fed to the module. Any authenticated user can\n          exploit this vulnerability, even the lowest privileged ones.\n          For more information refer to the advisory link below.",
