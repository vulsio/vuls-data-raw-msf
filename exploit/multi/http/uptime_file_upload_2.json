	"description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Uptime version 7.4.0 and 7.5.0.\n\n        The vulnerability began as a classic arbitrary file upload vulnerability in post2file.php,\n        which can be exploited by exploits/multi/http/uptime_file_upload_1.rb, but it was mitigated\n        by the vendor.\n\n        Although the mitigation in place will prevent uptime_file_upload_1.rb from working, it\n        can still be bypassed and gain privilege escalation, and allows the attacker to upload file\n        again, and execute arbitrary commands.",
