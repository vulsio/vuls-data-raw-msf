  "description": "This module can be used to execute a payload on Atlassian Jira via\n        the Universal Plugin Manager(UPM). The module requires valid login\n        credentials to an account that has access to the plugin manager.\n        The payload is uploaded as a JAR archive containing a servlet using\n        a POST request against the UPM component. The check command will\n        test the validity of user supplied credentials and test for access\n        to the plugin manager.",
