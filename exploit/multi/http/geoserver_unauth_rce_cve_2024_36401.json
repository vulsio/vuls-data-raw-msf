	"description": "GeoServer is an open-source software server written in Java that provides\n          the ability to view, edit, and share geospatial data.\n          It is designed to be a flexible, efficient solution for distributing geospatial data\n          from a variety of sources such as Geographic Information System (GIS) databases,\n          web-based data, and personal datasets.\n          In the GeoServer versions < 2.23.6, >= 2.24.0, < 2.24.4 and >= 2.25.0, < 2.25.1,\n          multiple OGC request parameters allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) by unauthenticated users\n          through specially crafted input against a default GeoServer installation due to unsafely\n          evaluating property names as XPath expressions.\n          An attacker can abuse this by sending a POST request with a malicious xpath expression\n          to execute arbitrary commands as root on the system.",
