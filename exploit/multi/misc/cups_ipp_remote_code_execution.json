	"description": "This module exploits vulnerabilities in OpenPrinting CUPS, which is running by\n          default on most Linux distributions. The vulnerabilities allow an attacker on\n          the LAN to advertise a malicious printer that triggers remote code execution\n          when a victim sends a print job to the malicious printer. Successful exploitation\n          requires user interaction, but no CUPS services need to be reachable via accessible\n          ports. Code execution occurs in the context of the lp user. Affected versions\n          are cups-browsed <= 2.0.1, libcupsfilters <= 2.1b1, libppd <= 2.1b1, and\n          cups-filters <= 2.0.1.",
