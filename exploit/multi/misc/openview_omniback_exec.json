This vulnerability was\n        discovered by DiGiT and his code was used as the basis for this\n        module.\n\n        For Microsoft Windows targets, due to module limitations, use the\n        \"unix/cmd/generic\" payload and set CMD to your command. You can only\n        pass a small amount of characters (4) to the command line on Windows.",
