  "description": "This module abuses a known default password on Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter.\n          The 'shrboadmin' user, installed by default by the product has the password of 'shrboadmin',\n          and allows an attacker to login to the server via SSH.\n          This module has been tested with Micro Focus Operations Bridge Manager 10.40. Earlier\n          versions are most likely affected too.\n          Note that this is only exploitable in Linux installations.",
