	"description": "This module abuses a known default password in IBM Data Risk Manager. The 'a3user'\n          has the default password 'idrm' and allows an attacker to log in to the virtual appliance\n          via SSH. This can be escalate to full root access, as 'a3user' has sudo access with the default password.\n          At the time of disclosure this was an 0day, but it was later confirmed and patched by IBM.\n          Versions <= 2.0.6.1 are confirmed to be vulnerable.",
