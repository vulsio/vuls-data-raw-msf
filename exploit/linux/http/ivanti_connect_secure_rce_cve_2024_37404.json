	"description": "This module exploits a CRLF injection vulnerability in Ivanti Connect\n          Secure to achieve remote code execution (CVE-2024-37404). Versions\n          prior to 22.7R2.1 are vulnerable. Note that Ivanti Policy Secure\n          versions prior to 22.7R1.1 are also vulnerable but this module\n          doesn't support this software.\n\n          Valid administrative credentials are required. A non-administrative\n          user is also required and can be created using the administrative\n          account, if needed.",
