  "description": "This module exploits a SQL injection and command injection vulnerability in MicroFocus Secure Messaging Gateway.\n        An unauthenticated user can execute a terminal command under the context of the web user.\n\n        One of the user supplied parameters of API endpoint is used by the application without input validation and/or parameter binding,\n        which leads to SQL injection vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this vulnerability gives a ability to add new user onto system.\n        manage_domains_dkim_keygen_request.php endpoint is responsible for executing an operation system command. It's not possible\n        to access this endpoint without having a valid session.\n\n        Combining these vulnerabilities gives the opportunity execute operation system commands under the context\n        of the web user.",
