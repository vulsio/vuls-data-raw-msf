	"description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability on WiFi Pineapples version 2.0 <= pineapple < 2.4.\n      We use a combination of default credentials with a weakness in the anti-csrf generation to achieve\n      command injection on fresh pineapple devices prior to configuration. Additionally if default credentials fail,\n      you can enable a brute force solver for the proof-of-ownership challenge. This will reset the password to a\n      known password if successful and may interrupt the user experience. These devices may typically be identified\n      by their SSID beacons of 'Pineapple5_....'; details derived from the TospoVirus, a WiFi Pineapple infecting\n      worm.",
