  "description": "TrueOnline is a major ISP in Thailand, and it distributes a customized version of\n        the ZyXEL P660HN-T v2 router. This customized version has an authenticated command injection\n        vulnerability in the remote log forwarding page. This can be exploited using the \"supervisor\"\n        account that comes with a default password on the device.\n        This module was tested in an emulated environment, as the author doesn't have access to the\n        Thai router any more. Any feedback should be sent directly to the module's author, as well as\n        to the Metasploit project. Note that the inline payloads work best.\n        There are Turkish and other language strings in the firmware, so it is likely that this\n        firmware is not only distributed in Thailand. Other P660HN-T v2 in other countries might be\n        vulnerable too.",
