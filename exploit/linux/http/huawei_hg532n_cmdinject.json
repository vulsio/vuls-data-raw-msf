  "description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the Huawei\n        HG532n routers provided by TE-Data Egypt, leading to a root shell.\n\n        The router's web interface has two kinds of logins, a \"limited\" user:user\n        login given to all customers and an admin mode. The limited mode is used\n        here to expose the router's telnet port to the outside world through NAT\n        port-forwarding.\n\n        With telnet now remotely accessible, the router's limited \"ATP command\n        line tool\" (served over telnet) can be upgraded to a root shell through\n        an injection into the ATP's hidden \"ping\" command.",
