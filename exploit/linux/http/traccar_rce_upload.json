	"description": "Remote Code Execution in Traccar v5.1 - v5.12.\n          Remote code execution can be obtained by combining two vulnerabilities: A path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2024-24809) and an unrestricted file upload vulnerability (CVE-2024-31214).\n          By default, the application allows self-registration, enabling any user to register an account and exploit the issues. Moreover, the application runs by default with root privileges, potentially resulting in a complete system compromise.\n          This module, which should work on any Red Hat-based Linux system, exploits these issues by adding a new cronjob file that executes the specified payload.",
