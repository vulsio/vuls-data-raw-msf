	"description": "Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in the Timelion visualizer.\n          An attacker with access to the Timelion application could send a request that will attempt to execute\n          javascript code. This leads to an arbitrary command execution with permissions of the\n          Kibana process on the host system.\n\n          Exploitation will require a service or system reboot to restore normal operation.\n\n          The WFSDELAY parameter is crucial for this exploit. Setting it too high will cause MANY shells\n          (50-100+), while setting it too low will cause no shells to be obtained. WFSDELAY of 10 for a\n          docker image caused 6 shells.\n\n          Tested against kibana 6.5.4.",
