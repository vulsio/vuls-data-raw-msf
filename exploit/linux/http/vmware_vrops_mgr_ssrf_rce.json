	"description": "This module exploits a pre-auth SSRF (CVE-2021-21975) and post-auth\n          file write (CVE-2021-21983) in VMware vRealize Operations Manager to\n          leak admin creds and write/execute a JSP payload.\n\n          CVE-2021-21975 affects the /casa/nodes/thumbprints endpoint, and\n          CVE-2021-21983 affects the /casa/private/config/slice/ha/certificate\n          endpoint. Code execution occurs as the \"admin\" Unix user.\n\n          The following vRealize Operations Manager versions are vulnerable:\n\n          * 7.0.0\n          * 7.5.0\n          * 8.0.0, 8.0.1\n          * 8.1.0, 8.1.1\n          * 8.2.0\n          * 8.3.0\n\n          Version 8.3.0 is not exploitable for creds and is therefore not\n          supported by this module. Tested successfully against 8.0.1, 8.1.0,\n          8.1.1, and 8.2.0.",
