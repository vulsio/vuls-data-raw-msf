	"description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Logsign.\n        By exploiting this vulnerability, unauthenticated users can execute\n        arbitrary code under the root user.\n\n        Logsign has a publicly accessible endpoint. That endpoint takes a user\n        input and then use it during operating system command execution without\n        proper validation.\n\n        This module was tested against 4.4.2 and 4.4.137 versions.",
