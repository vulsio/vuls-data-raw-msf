	"description": "Metabase versions before 0.46.6.1 contain a flaw where the secret setup-token\n          is accessible even after the setup process has been completed. With this token\n          a user is able to submit the setup functionality to create a new database.\n          When creating a new database, an H2 database string is created with a TRIGGER\n          that allows for code execution. We use a sample database for our connection\n          string to prevent corrupting real databases.\n\n          Successfully tested against Metabase 0.46.6.",
