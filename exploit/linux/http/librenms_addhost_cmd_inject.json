  "description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the open source\n         network management software known as LibreNMS. The community parameter used\n         in a POST request to the addhost functionality is unsanitized. This parameter\n         is later used as part of a shell command that gets passed to the popen function\n         in capture.inc.php, which can result in execution of arbitrary code.\n\n         This module requires authentication to LibreNMS first.",
