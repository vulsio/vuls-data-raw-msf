	"description": "This module exploits an authentication bypass (CVE-2021-1472) and command injection (CVE-2021-1473)\n          in the Cisco Small Business RV series of VPN/routers. The device does not adequately verify the\n          credentials in the HTTP Authorization field when requests are made to the /upload endpoint. Then\n          the upload.cgi binary will use the contents of the HTTP Cookie field as part of a `curl` request\n          aimed at an internal endpoint. The curl request is executed using `popen` and allows the attacker\n          to inject commands via the Cookie field.\n\n          A remote and unauthenticated attacker using this module is able to achieve code execution as `www-data`.\n\n          This module affects the RV340, RV340w, RV345, and RV345P using firmware versions 1.0.03.20 and below.",
