	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall,\n          Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router\n          could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.\n\n          The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface.\n          An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device.\n\n          A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating\n          system of the affected device as a high-privilege user.\n\n          RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall versions prior to 1.2.2.1 are affected.\n          RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router versions prior to 1.0.3.45 are affected.\n          RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router versions prior to 1.3.1.1 are affected.\n\n          Note: successful exploitation may not result in a session, and as such,\n          on_new_session will never repair the HTTP server, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
