	"description": "VMware vRealize Log Insights versions v8.x contains multiple vulnerabilities, such as\n          directory traversal, broken access control, deserialization, and information disclosure.\n          When chained together, these vulnerabilities allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to\n          execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the root user.\n\n          This module achieves code execution via triggering a `RemotePakDownloadCommand` command\n          via the exposed thrift service after obtaining the node token by calling a `GetConfigRequest`\n          thrift command. After the download, it will trigger a `PakUpgradeCommand` for processing the\n          specially crafted PAK archive, which then will place the JSP payload under a certain API\n          endpoint (pre-authenticated) location upon extraction for gaining remote code execution.\n\n          Successfully tested against version 8.0.2.",
