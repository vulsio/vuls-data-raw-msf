	"description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection in a variety of Hikvision IP\n          cameras (CVE-2021-36260). The module inserts a command into an XML payload used with an\n          HTTP PUT request sent to the `/SDK/webLanguage` endpoint, resulting in command execution\n          as the `root` user.\n\n          This module specifically attempts to exploit the blind variant of the attack. The module\n          was successfully tested against an HWI-B120-D/W using firmware V5.5.101 build 200408. It\n          was also tested against an unaffected DS-2CD2142FWD-I using firmware V5.5.0 build 170725.\n          Please see the Hikvision advisory for a full list of affected products.",
