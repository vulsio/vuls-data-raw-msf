	"description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated remote command execution\n        vulnerability in MVPower digital video recorders. The 'shell' file\n        on the web interface executes arbitrary operating system commands in\n        the query string.\n\n        This module was tested successfully on a MVPower model TV-7104HE with\n        firmware version 1.8.4 115215B9 (Build 2014/11/17).\n\n        The TV-7108HE model is also reportedly affected, but untested.",
