	"description": "Utilizing Rancher Server, an attacker can create a docker container\n        with the '/' path mounted with read/write permissions on the host\n        server that is running the docker container. As the docker container\n        executes command as uid 0 it is honored by the host operating system\n        allowing the attacker to edit/create files owed by root. This exploit\n        abuses this to creates a cron job in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of the\n        host server.\n\n        The Docker image should exist on the target system or be a valid image\n        from hub.docker.com.\n\n        Use `check` with verbose mode to get a list of exploitable Rancher\n        Hosts managed by the target system.",
