	"description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection\n          vulnerability in Cacti through 1.2.22 (CVE-2022-46169) in\n          order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the\n          www-data user.\n\n          The module first attempts to obtain the Cacti version to see\n          if the target is affected. If LOCAL_DATA_ID and/or HOST_ID\n          are not set, the module will try to bruteforce the missing\n          value(s). If a valid combination is found, the module will\n          use these to attempt exploitation. If LOCAL_DATA_ID and/or\n          HOST_ID are both set, the module will immediately attempt\n          exploitation.\n\n          During exploitation, the module sends a GET request to\n          /remote_agent.php with the action parameter set to polldata\n          and the X-Forwarded-For header set to the provided value for\n          X_FORWARDED_FOR_IP (by default 127.0.0.1). In addition, the\n          poller_id parameter is set to the payload and the host_id\n          and local_data_id parameters are set to the bruteforced or\n          provided values. If X_FORWARDED_FOR_IP is set to an address\n          that is resolvable to a hostname in the poller table, and the\n          local_data_id and host_id values are vulnerable, the payload\n          set for poller_id will be executed by the target.\n\n          This module has been successfully tested against Cacti\n          version 1.2.22 running on Ubuntu 21.10 (vulhub docker image)",
