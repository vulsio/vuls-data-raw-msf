	"description": "This module exploits a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability\n          in F5 Big-IP's iControl interface to write an arbitrary file to the\n          filesystem.\n\n          While any file can be written to any location as root, the\n          exploitability is limited by SELinux; the vast majority of writable\n          locations are unavailable. By default, we write to a script that\n          executes at reboot, which means the payload will execute the next time\n          the server boots.\n\n          An alternate target - Login - will add a backdoor that executes next\n          time a user logs in interactively. This overwrites a file,\n          but we restore it when we get a session\n\n          Note that because this is a CSRF vulnerability, it starts a web\n          server, but an authenticated administrator must visit the site, which\n          redirects them to the target.",
