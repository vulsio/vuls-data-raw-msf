	"description": "Utilizing Docker via unprotected tcp socket (2375/tcp, maybe 2376/tcp\n        with tls but without tls-auth), an attacker can create a Docker\n        container with the '/' path mounted with read/write permissions on the\n        host server that is running the Docker container. As the Docker\n        container executes command as uid 0 it is honored by the host operating\n        system allowing the attacker to edit/create files owned by root. This\n        exploit abuses this to creates a cron job in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of\n        the host server.\n\n        The Docker image should exist on the target system or be a valid image\n        from hub.docker.com.",
