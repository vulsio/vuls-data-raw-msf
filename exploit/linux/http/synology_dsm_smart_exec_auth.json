	"description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM)\n          versions < 5.2-5967-5, which allows the execution of arbitrary commands under root\n          privileges after website authentication.\n          The vulnerability is located in webman/modules/StorageManager/smart.cgi, which\n          allows appending of a command to the device to be scanned.  However, the command\n          with drive is limited to 30 characters.  A somewhat valid drive name is required,\n          thus /dev/sd is used, even though it doesn't exist.  To circumvent the character\n          restriction, a wget input file is staged in /a, and executed to download our payload\n          to /b.  From there the payload is executed.  A wfsdelay is required to give time\n          for the payload to download, and the execution of it to run.",
