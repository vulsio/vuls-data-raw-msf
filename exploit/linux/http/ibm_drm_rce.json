  "description": "IBM Data Risk Manager (IDRM) contains three vulnerabilities that can be chained by\n          an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution as root.\n          The first is an unauthenticated bypass, followed by a command injection as the server user,\n          and finally abuse of an insecure default password.\n          This module exploits all three vulnerabilities, giving the attacker a root shell.\n          At the time of disclosure this was an 0day, but it was later confirmed and patched by IBM.\n          The authentication bypass works on versions <= 2.0.6.1, but the command injection should only work on\n          versions <= 2.0.4 according to IBM.",
