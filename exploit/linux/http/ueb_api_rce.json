	"description": "It was discovered that the api/storage web interface in Unitrends Backup (UB)\n        before 10.0.0 has an issue in which one of its input parameters was not validated.\n        A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary\n        commands with root privilege on the target system.\n        UEB v9 runs the api under root privileges and api/storage is vulnerable.\n        UEB v10 runs the api under limited privileges and api/hosts is vulnerable.",
