	"description": "This module exploits an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in\n        Web Viewer 1.0.0.193 on Samsung SRN-1670D devices. The network_ssl_upload.php file\n        allows remote authenticated attackers to upload and execute arbitrary\n        PHP code via a filename with a .php extension, which is then accessed via a\n        direct request to the file in the upload/ directory.\n\n        To authenticate for this attack, one can obtain web-interface credentials\n        in cleartext by leveraging the existing local file read vulnerability\n        referenced by CVE-2015-8279, which allows remote attackers to read the\n        web interface credentials by sending a request to:\n        cslog_export.php?path=/root/php_modules/lighttpd/sbin/userpw URI.",
