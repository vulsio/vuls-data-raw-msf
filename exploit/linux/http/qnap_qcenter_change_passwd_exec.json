	"description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the\n        `change_passwd` API method within the web interface of QNAP Q'Center\n        virtual appliance versions prior to 1.7.1083.\n\n        The vulnerability allows the 'admin' privileged user account to\n        execute arbitrary commands as the 'admin' operating system user.\n\n        Valid credentials for the 'admin' user account are required, however,\n        this module also exploits a separate password disclosure issue which\n        allows any authenticated user to view the password set for the 'admin'\n        user during first install.\n\n        This module has been tested successfully on QNAP Q'Center appliance\n        version 1.6.1075.",
