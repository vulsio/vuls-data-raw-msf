  "description": "Utilizing the DCOS Cluster's Marathon UI, an attacker can create\n        a docker container with the '/' path mounted with read/write\n        permissions on the host server that is running the docker container.\n        As the docker container executes command as uid 0 it is honored\n        by the host operating system allowing the attacker to edit/create\n        files owed by root. This exploit abuses this to creates a cron job\n        in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of the host server.\n\n        *Notes: The docker image must be a valid docker image from\n        hub.docker.com. Furthermore the docker container will only\n        deploy if there are resources available in the DC/OS cluster.",
