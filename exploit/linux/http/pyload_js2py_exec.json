	"description": "pyLoad versions prior to 0.5.0b3.dev31 are vulnerable to Python code injection due to the pyimport\n          functionality exposed through the js2py library. An unauthenticated attacker can issue a crafted POST request\n          to the flash/addcrypted2 endpoint to leverage this for code execution. pyLoad by default runs two services,\n          the primary of which is on port 8000 and can not be used by external hosts. A secondary \"Click 'N' Load\"\n          service runs on port 9666 and can be used remotely without authentication.",
