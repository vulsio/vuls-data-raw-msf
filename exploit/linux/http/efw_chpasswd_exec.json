	"description": "This module exploits an OS command injection vulnerability in a\n        web-accessible CGI script used to change passwords for locally-defined\n        proxy user accounts. Valid credentials for such an account are\n        required.\n\n        Command execution will be in the context of the \"nobody\" account, but\n        this account had broad sudo permissions, including to run the script\n        /usr/local/bin/chrootpasswd (which changes the password for the Linux\n        root account on the system to the value specified by console input\n        once it is executed).\n\n        The password for the proxy user account specified will *not* be\n        changed by the use of this module, as long as the target system is\n        vulnerable to the exploit.\n\n        Very early versions of Endian Firewall (e.g. 1.1 RC5) require\n        HTTP basic auth credentials as well to exploit this vulnerability.\n        Use the USERNAME and PASSWORD advanced options to specify these values\n        if required.\n\n        Versions >= 3.0.0 still contain the vulnerable code, but it appears to\n        never be executed due to a bug in the vulnerable CGI script which also\n        prevents normal use (http://jira.endian.com/browse/UTM-1002).\n\n        Versions 2.3.x and 2.4.0 are not vulnerable because of a similar bug\n        (http://bugs.endian.com/print_bug_page.php?bug_id=3083).\n\n        Tested successfully against the following versions of EFW Community:\n\n        1.1 RC5, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.5.1, 2.5.2.\n\n        Should function against any version from 1.1 RC5 to 2.2.x, as well as\n        2.4.1 and 2.5.x.",
