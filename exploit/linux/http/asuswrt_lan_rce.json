  "description": "The HTTP server in AsusWRT has a flaw where it allows an unauthenticated client to\n      perform a POST in certain cases. This can be combined with another vulnerability in\n      the VPN configuration upload routine that sets NVRAM configuration variables directly\n      from the POST request to enable a special command mode.\n      This command mode can then be abused by sending a UDP packet to infosvr, which is running\n      on port UDP 9999 to directly execute commands as root.\n      This exploit leverages that to start telnetd in a random port, and then connects to it.\n      It has been tested with the RT-AC68U running AsusWRT Version 3.0.0.4.380.7743.",
