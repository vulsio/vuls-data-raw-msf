  "description": "This module exploits a remote file include vulnerability in Railo,\n                      tested against version 4.2.1. First, a call using a vulnerable\n                      <cffile> line in thumbnail.cfm allows an attacker to download an\n                      arbitrary PNG file. By appending a .cfm, and taking advantage of\n                      a directory traversal, an attacker can append cold fusion markup\n                      to the PNG file, and have it interpreted by the server. This is\n                      used to stage and execute a fully-fledged payload.",
