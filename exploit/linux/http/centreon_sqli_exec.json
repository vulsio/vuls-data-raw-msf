  "description": "This module exploits several vulnerabilities on Centreon 2.5.1 and prior and Centreon\n        Enterprise Server 2.2 and prior. Due to a combination of SQL injection and command\n        injection in the displayServiceStatus.php component, it is possible to execute arbitrary\n        commands as long as there is a valid session registered in the centreon.session table.\n        In order to have a valid session, all it takes is a successful login from anybody.\n        The exploit itself does not require any authentication.\n\n        This module has been tested successfully on Centreon Enterprise Server 2.2.",
