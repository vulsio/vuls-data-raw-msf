	"description": "This is an exploit for the Poptop negative read overflow.  This will\n        work against versions prior to 1.1.3-b3 and 1.1.3-20030409, but I\n        currently do not have a good way to detect Poptop versions.\n\n        The server will by default only allow 4 concurrent manager processes\n        (what we run our code in), so you could have a max of 4 shells at once.\n\n        Using the current method of exploitation, our socket will be closed\n        before we have the ability to run code, preventing the use of Findsock.",
