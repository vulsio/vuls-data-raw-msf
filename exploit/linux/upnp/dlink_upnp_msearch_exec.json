	"description": "A command injection vulnerability exists in multiple D-Link network products, allowing an attacker\n          to inject arbitrary command to the UPnP via a crafted M-SEARCH packet.\n          Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), by default is enabled in most D-Link devices, on the port 1900.\n          An attacker can perform a remote command execution by injecting the payload into the\n          `Search Target` (ST) field of the SSDP M-SEARCH discover packet.\n          After successful exploitation, an attacker will have full access with `root` user privileges.\n\n          NOTE: Staged meterpreter payloads might core dump on the target, so use stage-less meterpreter payloads\n          when using the Linux Dropper target. Some D-Link devices do not have the `wget` command so\n          configure `echo` as flavor with the command set CMDSTAGER::FLAVOR echo.\n\n          The following D-Link network products and firmware are vulnerable:\n          - D-Link Router model GO-RT-AC750 revisions Ax with firmware v1.01 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-300 revisions Ax with firmware v1.06 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-300 revisions Bx with firmware v2.15 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-600 revisions Bx with firmware v2.18 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-645 revisions Ax with firmware v1.05 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-815 revisions Bx with firmware v1.04 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-816L revisions Bx with firmware v2.06 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-817LW revisions Ax with firmware v1.04b01_hotfix or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-818LW revisions Bx with firmware v2.05b03_Beta08 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-822 revisions Bx with firmware v2.03b01 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-822 revisions Cx with firmware v3.12b04 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-823 revisions Ax with firmware v1.00b06_Beta or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-845L revisions Ax with firmware v1.02b05 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-860L revisions Ax with firmware v1.12b05 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-859 revisions Ax with firmware v1.06b01Beta01 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-860L revisions Ax with firmware v1.10b04 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-860L revisions Bx with firmware v2.03b03 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-865L revisions Ax with firmware v1.07b01 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-868L revisions Ax with firmware v1.12b04 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-868L revisions Bx with firmware v2.05b02 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-869 revisions Ax with firmware v1.03b02Beta02 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-880L revisions Ax with firmware v1.08b04 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-890L/R revisions Ax with firmware v1.11b01_Beta01 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-885L/R revisions Ax with firmware v1.12b05 or older;\n          - D-Link Router model DIR-895L/R revisions Ax with firmware v1.12b10 or older;\n          - probably more looking at the scale of impacted devices :-(",
