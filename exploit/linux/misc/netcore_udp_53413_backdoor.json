	"description": "Routers manufactured by Netcore, a popular brand for networking\n        equipment in China, have a wide-open backdoor that can be fairly\n        easily exploited by attackers. These products are also sold under\n        the Netis brand name outside of China. This backdoor allows\n        cyber criminals to easily run arbitrary code on these routers,\n        rendering it vulnerable as a security device.\n        Some models include a non-standard echo command which doesn't\n        honor -e, and are therefore not currently exploitable with\n        Metasploit.  See URLs or module markdown for additional options.",
