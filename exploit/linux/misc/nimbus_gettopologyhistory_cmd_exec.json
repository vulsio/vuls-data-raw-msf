	"description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability within the Nimbus service component of Apache Storm.\n          The getTopologyHistory RPC method method takes a single argument which is the name of a user which is\n          concatenated into a string that is executed by bash. In order for the vulnerability to be exploitable, there\n          must have been at least one topology submitted to the server. The topology may be active or inactive, but at\n          least one must be present. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution as the user running Apache Storm.\n\n          This vulnerability was patched in versions 2.1.1, 2.2.1 and 1.2.4. This exploit was tested on version 2.2.0\n          which is affected.",
