	"description": "VMWare Workstation (up to and including 9.0.2 build-1031769)\n            and Player have a setuid executable called vmware-mount that\n            invokes lsb_release in the PATH with popen(3). Since PATH is\n            user-controlled, and the default system shell on\n            Debian-derived distributions does not drop privs, we can put\n            an arbitrary payload in an executable called lsb_release and\n            have vmware-mount happily execute it as root for us.",
