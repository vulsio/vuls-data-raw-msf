  "description": "This creates a local user with a username/password and root-level\n          privileges. Note that a root-level account is not required to do this,\n          which makes it a privilege escalation issue.\n\n          Note that this is pretty noisy, since it creates a user account and\n          creates log files and such. Additionally, most (if not all)\n          vulnerabilities in F5 grant root access anyways.\n\n          Adapted from https://github.com/rbowes-r7/refreshing-mcp-tool/blob/main/mcp-privesc.rb",
