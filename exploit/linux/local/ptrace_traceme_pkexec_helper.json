	"description": "This module exploits an issue in ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c before Linux\n          kernel 5.1.17. This issue can be exploited from a Linux desktop terminal, but\n          not over an SSH session, as it requires execution from within the context of\n          a user with an active Polkit agent.\n          In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles\n          the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace\n          relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging\n          certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops\n          privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One\n          contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic).\n          Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as\n          privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper\n          with PTRACE_TRACEME.",
