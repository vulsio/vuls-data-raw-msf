	"description": "A vulnerability exists within the polkit system service that can be leveraged by a local, unprivileged\n          attacker to perform privileged operations. In order to leverage the vulnerability, the attacker invokes a\n          method over D-Bus and kills the client process. This will occasionally cause the operation to complete without\n          being subjected to all of the necessary authentication.\n          The exploit module leverages this to add a new user with a sudo access and a known password. The new account\n          is then leveraged to execute a payload with root privileges.",
