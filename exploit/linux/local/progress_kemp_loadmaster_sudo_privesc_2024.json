	"description": "This module abuses a feature of the sudo command on Progress Kemp\n          LoadMaster.  Certain binary files are allowed to automatically elevate\n          with the sudo command.  This is based off of the file name.  Some files\n          have this permission are not write-protected from the default 'bal' user.\n          As such, if the file is overwritten with an arbitrary file, it will still\n          auto-elevate.  This module overwrites the /bin/loadkeys file with another\n          executable.",
