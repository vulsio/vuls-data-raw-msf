	"description": "A race condition flaw was found in the PolicyKit pkexec utility and polkitd\n        daemon. A local user could use this flaw to appear as a privileged user to\n        pkexec, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands as root by running\n        those commands with pkexec.\n\n        Those vulnerable include RHEL6 prior to polkit-0.96-2.el6_0.1 and Ubuntu\n        libpolkit-backend-1 prior to 0.96-2ubuntu1.1 (10.10) 0.96-2ubuntu0.1\n        (10.04 LTS) and 0.94-1ubuntu1.1 (9.10)",
