	"description": "This module leverages a flaw in `runc` to escape a Docker container\n          and get command execution on the host as root. This vulnerability is\n          identified as CVE-2019-5736. It overwrites the `runc` binary with the\n          payload and wait for someone to use `docker exec` to get into the\n          container. This will trigger the payload execution.\n\n          Note that executing this exploit carries important risks regarding\n          the Docker installation integrity on the target and inside the\n          container ('Side Effects' section in the documentation).",
