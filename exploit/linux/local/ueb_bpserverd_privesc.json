  "description": "It was discovered that the Unitrends bpserverd proprietary protocol, as exposed via xinetd,\n        has an issue in which its authentication can be bypassed.  A remote attacker could use this\n        issue to execute arbitrary commands with root privilege on the target system.\n        This is very similar to exploits/linux/misc/ueb9_bpserverd however it runs against the\n        localhost by dropping a python script on the local file system.  Unitrends stopped\n        bpserverd from listening remotely on version 10.",
