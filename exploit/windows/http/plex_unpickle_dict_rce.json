  "description": "This module exploits an authenticated Python unsafe pickle.load of a Dict file.  An authenticated attacker\n          can create a photo library and add arbitrary files to it.  After setting the Windows only Plex variable\n          LocalAppDataPath to the newly created photo library, a file named Dict will be unpickled, which causes\n          an RCE as the user who started Plex.\n          Plex_Token is required, to get it you need to log-in through a web browser, then check the requests to grab\n          the X-Plex-Token header.  See info -d for additional details.\n          If an exploit fails, or is cancelled, Dict is left on disk, a new ALBUM_NAME will be required\n          as subsuquent writes will make Dict-1, and not execute.",
