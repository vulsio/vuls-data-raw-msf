	"description": "The Rejetto HTTP File Server (HFS) version 2.x is vulnerable to an unauthenticated server side template\n          injection (SSTI) vulnerability. A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute code with the privileges\n          of the user account running the HFS.exe server process. This exploit has been tested to work against version\n          2.4.0 RC7 and 2.3m. The Rejetto HTTP File Server (HFS) version 2.x is no longer supported by the maintainers\n          and no patch is available. Users are recommended to upgrade to newer supported versions.",
