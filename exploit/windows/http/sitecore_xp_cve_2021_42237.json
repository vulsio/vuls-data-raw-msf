  "description": "This module exploits a deserialization vulnerability in the Report.ashx page\n          of Sitecore XP 7.5 to 7.5.2, 8.0 to 8.0.7, 8.1 to 8.1.3, and 8.2 to 8.2.7.\n          Versions 7.2.6 and earlier and 9.0 and later are not affected.\n\n          The vulnerability occurs due to Report.ashx's handler, located in Sitecore.Xdb.Client.dll\n          under the Sitecore.sitecore.shell.ClientBin.Reporting.Report defintion, having a ProcessRequest()\n          handler that calls ProcessReport() with the context of the attacker's request without properly\n          checking if the attacker is authenticated or not.\n\n          This request then causes ReportDataSerializer.DeserializeQuery() to be called, which will\n          end up calling the DeserializeParameters() function of\n          Sitecore.Analytics.Reporting.ReportDataSerializer, if a \"parameters\" XML tag is found in\n          the attacker's request.\n\n          Then for each subelement named \"parameter\", the code will check that it has a name and\n          if it does, it will call NetDataContractSerializer().ReadObject on it. NetDataContractSerializer is\n          vulnerable to deserialization attacks and can be trivially exploited by using the\n          TypeConfuseDelegate gadget chain.\n\n          By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution as the user\n          that IIS is running as, aka NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE. Users can then use technique 4\n          of the \"getsystem\" command to use RPCSS impersonation and get SYSTEM level code execution.",
