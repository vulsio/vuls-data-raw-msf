  "description": "This module exploits an injection vulnerability in Cogent DataHub prior\n        to 7.3.5. The vulnerability exists in the GetPermissions.asp page, which\n        makes insecure use of the datahub_command function with user controlled\n        data, allowing execution of arbitrary datahub commands and scripts. This\n        module has been tested successfully with Cogent DataHub 7.3.4 on\n        Windows 7 SP1. Please also note that after exploitation, the remote service\n        will most likely hang and restart manually.",
