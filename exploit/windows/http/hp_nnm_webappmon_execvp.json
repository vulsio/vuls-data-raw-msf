  "description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53\n        prior to NNM_01207 or NNM_01206 without the SSRT100025 hotfix. By specifying a long 'sel'\n        parameter when calling methods within the 'webappmon.exe' CGI program, an attacker can\n        cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code.\n\n        This vulnerability is not triggerable via a GET request due to limitations on the\n        request size. The buffer being targeted is 16384 bytes in size. There are actually two\n        adjacent buffers that both get overflowed (one into the other), and strcat is used.\n\n        The vulnerable code is within the \"execvp_nc\" function within \"ov.dll\" prior to\n        v 1.30.12.69. There are no stack cookies, so exploitation is easily achieved by\n        overwriting the saved return address or SEH frame.\n\n        This vulnerability might also be triggerable via other CGI programs, however this was\n        not fully investigated.",
