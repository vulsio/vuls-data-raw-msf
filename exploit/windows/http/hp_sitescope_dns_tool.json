	"description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability\n        discovered in HP SiteScope 11.30 and earlier versions (tested in 11.26\n        and 11.30). The vulnerability exists in the DNS Tool allowing an\n        attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the service. By\n        default, HP SiteScope installs and runs as SYSTEM in Windows and does\n        not require authentication. This vulnerability only exists on the\n        Windows version. The Linux version is unaffected.",
