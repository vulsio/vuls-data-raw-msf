  "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in MiniWeb HTTP server (build 300).\n        The software contains a file upload vulnerability that allows an\n        unauthenticated remote attacker to write arbitrary files to the file system.\n\n        Code execution can be achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote\n        machine as an exe file, and then upload another mof file, which enables\n        WMI (Management Instrumentation service) to execute the uploaded payload.\n        Please note that this module currently only works for Windows before Vista.",
