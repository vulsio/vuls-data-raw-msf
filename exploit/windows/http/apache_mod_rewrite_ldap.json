  "description": "This module exploits the mod_rewrite LDAP protocol scheme handling\n        flaw discovered by Mark Dowd, which produces an off-by-one overflow.\n        Apache versions 1.3.29-36, 2.0.47-58, and 2.2.1-2 are vulnerable.\n        This module requires REWRITEPATH to be set accurately. In addition,\n        the target must have 'RewriteEngine on' configured, with a specific\n        'RewriteRule' condition enabled to allow for exploitation.\n\n        The flaw affects multiple platforms, however this module currently\n        only supports Windows based installations.",
