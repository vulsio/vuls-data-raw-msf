	"description": "A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists within HPE System Insight Manager (SIM) version 7.6.x that can be\n          leveraged by a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute code within the context of HPE System Insight\n          Manager's hpsimsvc.exe process, which runs with administrative privileges. The vulnerability occurs due\n          to a failure to validate data during the deserialization process when a user submits a POST request to\n          the /simsearch/messagebroker/amfsecure page. This module exploits this vulnerability by leveraging an\n          outdated copy of Commons Collection, namely 3.2.2, that ships with HPE SIM, to gain\n          RCE as the administrative user running HPE SIM.",
