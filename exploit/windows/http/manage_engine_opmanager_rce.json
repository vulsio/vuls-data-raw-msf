	"description": "This module exploits a default credential vulnerability in ManageEngine OpManager, where a\n        default hidden account \"IntegrationUser\" with administrator privileges exists. The account\n        has a default password of \"plugin\" which cannot be reset through the user interface. By\n        log-in and abusing the default administrator's SQL query functionality, it's possible to\n        write a WAR payload to disk and trigger an automatic deployment of this payload. This\n        module has been tested successfully on OpManager v11.0 and v11.4-v11.6 for Windows.",
