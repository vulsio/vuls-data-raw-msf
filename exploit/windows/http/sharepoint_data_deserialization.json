	"description": "A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists within SharePoint that can be leveraged by a remote authenticated\n          attacker to execute code within the context of the SharePoint application service. The privileges in this\n          execution context are determined by the account that is specified when SharePoint is installed and configured.\n          The vulnerability is related to a failure to validate the source of XML input data, leading to an unsafe\n          deserialization operation that can be triggered from a page that initializes either the\n          ContactLinksSuggestionsMicroView type or a derivative of it. In a default configuration, a Domain User account\n          is sufficient to access SharePoint and exploit this vulnerability.",
