	"description": "This module exploits the \"custom script\" feature of ADSelfService Plus. The\n          feature was removed in build 6122 as part of the patch for CVE-2022-28810.\n          For purposes of this module, a \"custom script\" is arbitrary operating system\n          command execution.\n\n          This module uses an attacker provided \"admin\" account to insert the malicious\n          payload into the custom script fields. When a user resets their password or\n          unlocks their account, the payload in the custom script will be executed.\n          The payload will be executed as SYSTEM if ADSelfService Plus is installed as\n          a service, which we believe is the normal operational behavior.\n\n          This is a passive module because user interaction is required to trigger the\n          payload. This module also does not automatically remove the malicious code from\n          the remote target. Use the \"TARGET_RESET\" operation to remove the malicious\n          custom script when you are done.\n\n          ADSelfService Plus uses default credentials of \"admin\":\"admin\"",
