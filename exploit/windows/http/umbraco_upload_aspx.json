	"description": "This module can be used to execute a payload on Umbraco CMS 4.7.0.378.\n        The payload is uploaded as an ASPX script by sending a specially crafted\n        SOAP request to codeEditorSave.asmx, which permits unauthorized file upload\n        via the SaveDLRScript operation. SaveDLRScript is also subject to a path\n        traversal vulnerability, allowing code to be placed into the web-accessible\n        /umbraco/ directory.\n\n        The module writes, executes and then overwrites an ASPX script; note that\n        though the script content is removed, the file remains on the target. Automatic\n        cleanup of the file is intended if a meterpreter payload is used.\n\n        This module has been tested successfully on Umbraco CMS 4.7.0.378 on a Windows\n        7 32-bit SP1. In this scenario, the \"IIS APPPOOL\\ASP.NET v4.0\" user must have\n        write permissions on the Windows Temp folder.",
