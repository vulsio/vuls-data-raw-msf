	"description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated configuration change combined\n          with an unauthenticated file write primitive, leading to an arbitrary\n          file write that allows for remote code execution as the user running\n          iView, which is typically NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.\n\n          This issue was demonstrated in the vulnerable version 5.7.02.5992 and\n          fixed in version 5.7.03.6112.",
