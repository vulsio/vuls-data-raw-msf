	"description": "This module exploits a vulnerability on Microsoft Exchange Server that\n          allows an attacker to bypass the authentication (CVE-2021-31207), impersonate an\n          arbitrary user (CVE-2021-34523) and write an arbitrary file (CVE-2021-34473) to achieve\n          the RCE (Remote Code Execution).\n\n          By taking advantage of this vulnerability, you can execute arbitrary\n          commands on the remote Microsoft Exchange Server.\n\n          This vulnerability affects Exchange 2013 CU23 < 15.0.1497.15,\n          Exchange 2016 CU19 < 15.1.2176.12, Exchange 2016 CU20 < 15.1.2242.5,\n          Exchange 2019 CU8 < 15.2.792.13, Exchange 2019 CU9 < 15.2.858.9.\n\n          All components are vulnerable by default.",
