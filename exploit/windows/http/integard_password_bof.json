	"description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Race river's Integard Home/Pro\n          internet content filter HTTP Server. Versions prior to 2.0.0.9037 and 2.2.0.9037 are\n          vulnerable.\n\n          The administration web page on port 18881 is vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow\n          attack. By sending a long character string in the password field, both the structured\n          exception handler and the saved extended instruction pointer are over written, allowing\n          an attacker to gain control of the application and the underlying operating system\n          remotely.\n\n          The administration website service runs with SYSTEM privileges, and automatically\n          restarts when it crashes.",
