	"description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Windows Media\n        Unicast Service version 4.1.0.3930 (NUMS.exe). By sending a specially\n        crafted FunnelConnect request, an attacker can execute arbitrary code\n        under the \"NetShowServices\" user account. Windows Media Services 4.1 ships\n        with Windows 2000 Server, but is not installed by default.\n\n        NOTE: This service does NOT restart automatically. Successful, as well as\n        unsuccessful exploitation attempts will kill the service which prevents\n        additional attempts.",
