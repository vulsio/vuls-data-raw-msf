  "description": "This module abuses multiple issues in FreeFloat: 1. No credential is actually\n        needed to login; 2. User's default path is in C:\\, and this cannot be changed;\n        3. User can write to anywhere on the server's file system.  As a result of these\n        poor implementations, a malicious user can just log in and then upload files,\n        and let WMI (Management Instrumentation service) to execute the payload uploaded.",
