	"description": "This is an exploit for the Serv-U\\'s MDTM command timezone\n        overflow. It has been heavily tested against versions\n        4.0.0.4/4.1.0.0/4.1.0.3/5.0.0.0 with success against\n        nt4/2k/xp/2k3. I have also had success against version 3,\n        but only tested 1 version/os. The bug is in all versions\n        prior to 5.0.0.4, but this exploit will not work against\n        versions not listed above. You only get one shot, but it\n        should be OS/SP independent.\n\n        This exploit is a single hit, the service dies after the\n        shellcode finishes execution.",
