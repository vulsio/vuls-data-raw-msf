	"description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in QuickShare File Server's FTP\n        service.  By supplying \"../\" in the file path, it is possible to trigger a\n        directory traversal flaw, allowing the attacker to read a file outside the\n        virtual directory.  By default, the \"Writable\" option is enabled during account\n        creation, therefore this makes it possible to create a file at an arbitrary\n        location, which leads to remote code execution.",
