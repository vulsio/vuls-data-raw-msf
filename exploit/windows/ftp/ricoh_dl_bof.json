  "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Ricoh DC's DL-10 SR10 FTP\n        service.  By supplying a long string of data to the USER command, it is\n        possible to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, which allows remote code\n        execution under the context of the user.\n\n          Please note that in order to trigger the vulnerability, the server must\n        be configured with a log file name (by default, it's disabled).",
