  "description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow FTPPad 1.2.0 ftp client. The overflow is\n        triggered when the client connects to a FTP server which sends an overly long directory\n        and filename in response to a LIST command.\n\n        This will cause an access violation, and will eventually overwrite the saved extended\n        instruction pointer.  Payload can be found at EDX+5c and ESI+5c, so a little pivot/\n        sniper was needed to make this one work.",
