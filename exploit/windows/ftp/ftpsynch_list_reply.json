  "description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in FTP Synchronizer Pro\n        version 4.0.73.274 The overflow gets triggered by sending an overly long filename to\n        the client in response to a LIST command.\n        The LIST command gets issued when doing a preview or when you have just created a new\n        sync profile and allow the tool to see the differences.\n        This will overwrite a structured exception handler and trigger an access violation.",
