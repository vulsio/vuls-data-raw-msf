  "description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in Ability Server 2.34.\n        Ability Server fails to check input size when parsing 'STOR' and 'APPE' commands,\n        which leads to a stack based buffer overflow. This plugin uses the 'STOR' command.\n\n        The vulnerability has been confirmed on version 2.34 and has also been reported\n        in version 2.25 and 2.32. Other versions may also be affected.",
