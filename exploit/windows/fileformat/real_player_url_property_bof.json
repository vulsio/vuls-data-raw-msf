	"description": "This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow on RealPlayer <=15.0.6.14.\n        The vulnerability exists in the handling of real media files, due to the insecure\n        usage of the GetPrivateProfileString function to retrieve the URL property from an\n        InternetShortcut section.\n\n        This module generates a malicious rm file which must be opened with RealPlayer via\n        drag and drop or double click methods. It has been tested successfully on Windows\n        XP SP3 with RealPlayer 15.0.5.109.",
