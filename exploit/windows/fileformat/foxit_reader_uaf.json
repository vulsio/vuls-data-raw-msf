	"description": "Foxit PDF Reader v9.0.1.1049 has a Use-After-Free vulnerability\n        in the Text Annotations component and the TypedArray's use\n        uninitialized pointers.\n\n        The vulnerabilities can be combined to leak a vtable memory address,\n        which can be adjusted to point to the base address of the executable.\n        A ROP chain can be constructed that will execute when Foxit Reader\n        performs the UAF.\n\n        This module has been tested on Windows 7 x64, Windows 10 Pro x64\n        Build 17134, and Windows 10 Enterprise x64. Windows 10 Enterprise\n        must have insecure logons enabled for the exploit to work as expected.",
