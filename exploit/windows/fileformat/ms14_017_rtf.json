  "description": "This module creates a malicious RTF file that when opened in\n        vulnerable versions of Microsoft Word will lead to code execution.\n        The flaw exists in how a listoverridecount field can be modified\n        to treat one structure as another.\n\n        This bug was originally seen being exploited in the wild starting\n        in April 2014. This module was created by reversing a public\n        malware sample.",
