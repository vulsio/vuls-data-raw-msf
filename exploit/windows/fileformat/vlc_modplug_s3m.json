  "description": "This module exploits an input validation error in libmod_plugin as\n        included with VideoLAN VLC 1.1.8. All versions prior to version 1.1.9\n        are affected. By creating a malicious S3M file, a remote attacker\n        could execute arbitrary code.\n\n        Although other products that bundle libmodplug may be vulnerable, this\n        module was only tested against VLC.\n\n        NOTE: As of July 1st, 2010, VLC now calls SetProcessDEPPoly to\n        permanently enable NX support on machines that support it. As such,\n        this module is capable of bypassing DEP, but not ASLR.",
