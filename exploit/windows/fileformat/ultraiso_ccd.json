  "description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in EZB Systems, Inc's\n        UltraISO. When processing .CCD files, data is read from file into a\n        fixed-size stack buffer. Since no bounds checking is done, a buffer overflow\n        can occur. Attackers can execute arbitrary code by convincing their victim\n        to open an CCD file.\n\n        NOTE: A file with the same base name, but the extension of \"img\" must also\n        exist. Opening either file will trigger the vulnerability, but the files must\n        both exist.",
