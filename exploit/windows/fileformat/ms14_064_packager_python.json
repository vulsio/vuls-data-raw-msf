	"description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)\n        allowing arbitrary code execution, bypassing the patch MS14-060, for the vulnerability\n        publicly known as \"Sandworm\", on systems with Python for Windows installed. Windows Vista\n        SP2 all the way to Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 and 2012 are known to be vulnerable.\n        However, based on our testing, the most reliable setup is on Windows platforms running\n        Office 2013 and Office 2010 SP2. Please keep in mind that some other setups such as\n        those using Office 2010 SP1 may be less stable, and may end up with a crash due to a\n        failure in the CPackage::CreateTempFileName function.",
