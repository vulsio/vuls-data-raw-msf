  "description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow found in the handling\n        of SAMI subtitles files in MPlayer SVN Versions before 33471. It currently\n        targets SMPlayer 0.6.8, which is distributed with a vulnerable version of MPlayer.\n\n        The overflow is triggered when an unsuspecting victim opens a movie file first,\n        followed by loading the malicious SAMI subtitles file from the GUI. Or, it can also\n        be done from the console with the MPlayer \"-sub\" option.",
