	"description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in the MS10-046 patch to abuse (again) the handling\n        of Windows Shortcut files (.LNK) that contain an icon resource pointing to a malicious\n        DLL. This module creates the required files to exploit the vulnerability. They must be\n        uploaded to an UNC path accessible by the target. This module has been tested successfully\n        on Windows 2003 SP2 with MS10-046 installed and Windows 2008 SP2 (32 bits) with MS14-027\n        installed.",
