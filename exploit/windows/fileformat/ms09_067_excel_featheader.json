  "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in the handling of the FEATHEADER record\n          by Microsoft Excel. Revisions of Office XP and later prior to the release of the\n          MS09-067 bulletin are vulnerable.\n\n          When processing a FEATHEADER (Shared Feature) record, Microsoft used a data\n          structure from the file to calculate a pointer offset without doing proper\n          validation. Attacker supplied data is then used to calculate the location of an\n          object, and in turn a virtual function call. This results in arbitrary code\n          execution.\n\n          NOTE: On some versions of Office, the user will need to dismiss a warning dialog\n          prior to the payload executing.",
