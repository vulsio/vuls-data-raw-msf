	"description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in\n        i-Ftp v2.20, caused by a long time value set for scheduled download.\n\n        By persuading the victim to place a specially-crafted Schedule.xml file\n        in the i-FTP folder, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on\n        the system or cause the application to crash. This module has been\n        tested successfully on Windows XP SP3.",
