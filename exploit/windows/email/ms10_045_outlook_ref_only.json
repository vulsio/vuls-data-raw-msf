  "description": "It has been discovered that certain e-mail message cause Outlook to create Windows\n        shortcut-like attachments or messages within Outlook. Through specially crafted TNEF\n        streams with certain MAPI attachment properties, it is possible to set a path name\n        to files to be executed. When a user double clicks on such an attachment or message,\n        Outlook will proceed to execute the file that is set by the path name value. These\n        files can be local files, but also files stored remotely (on a file share, for example)\n        can be used. Exploitation is limited by the fact that it is not possible for attackers\n        to supply command line options.",
