Please note that by default,\n        this exploit will attempt up to three times in order to successfully gain remote code\n        execution (in some cases, it takes as many as five times).  This can cause your activity\n        to look even more suspicious.  To modify the number of exploit attempts, set the\n        ATTEMPTS option.",
