HP LoadRunner 12.53 and other versions are\n        also most likely vulneable if the (non-default) SSL option is turned off.\n        By sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker can execute commands remotely.\n        The service is vulnerable provided the Secure Channel feature is disabled (default).",
