  "description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Express Remote\n        Client Agent service. By sending a \"dicuGetIdentify\" request packet containing a long\n        NodeName parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code.\n\n        NOTE: this exploit first connects to the CAD service to start the RCA service and obtain\n        the port number on which it runs. This service does not restart.",
