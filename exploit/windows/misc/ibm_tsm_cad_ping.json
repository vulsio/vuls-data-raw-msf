  "description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Express CAD Service.\n        By sending a \"ping\" packet containing a long string, an attacker can execute arbitrary code.\n\n        NOTE: the dsmcad.exe service must be in a particular state (CadWaitingStatus = 1) in order\n        for the vulnerable code to be reached. This state doesn't appear to be reachable when the\n        TSM server is not running. This service does not restart.",
