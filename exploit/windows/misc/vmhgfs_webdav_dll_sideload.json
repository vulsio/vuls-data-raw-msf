This issue can be exploited by luring a victim into\n      opening a document from the attacker's share. An attacker can exploit this issue to\n      execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the target user. This can potentially\n      result in the attacker taking complete control of the affected system. If the WebDAV\n      Mini-Redirector is enabled, it is possible to exploit this issue over the internet.",
