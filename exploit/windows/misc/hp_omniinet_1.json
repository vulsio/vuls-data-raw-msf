	"description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in the Hewlett-Packard\n        OmniInet NT Service. By sending a specially crafted MSG_PROTOCOL (0x010b)\n        packet, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with elevated\n        privileges.\n\n        This service is installed with HP OpenView Data Protector, HP Application\n        Recovery Manager and potentially other products. This exploit has been tested\n        against versions 6.1, 6.0, and 5.50 of Data Protector. and versions 6.0 and 6.1\n        of Application Recovery Manager.\n\n        NOTE: There are actually two consecutive wcscpy() calls in the program (which\n        may be why ZDI considered them two separate issues). However, this module only\n        exploits the first one.",
