  "description": "This module exploits a SQL query functionality in ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer v10.6\n        build 10060 and previous versions. Every authenticated user, including the default \"guest\"\n        account can execute SQL queries directly on the underlying Postgres database server. The\n        queries are executed as the \"postgres\" user which has full privileges and thus is able to\n        write files to disk. This way a JSP payload can be uploaded and executed with SYSTEM\n        privileges on the web server. This module has been tested successfully on ManageEngine\n        EventLog Analyzer 10.0 (build 10003) over Windows 7 SP1.",
