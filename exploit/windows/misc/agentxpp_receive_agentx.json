  "description": "This exploits a stack buffer overflow in the AgentX++ library, as used by\n        various applications. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker can\n        execute arbitrary code, potentially with SYSTEM privileges.\n\n        This module was tested successfully against master.exe as included with Real\n        Network\\'s Helix Server v12. When installed as a service with Helix Server,\n        the service runs as SYSTEM, has no recovery action, but will start automatically\n        on boot.\n\n        This module does not work with NX/XD enabled but could be modified easily to\n        do so.
