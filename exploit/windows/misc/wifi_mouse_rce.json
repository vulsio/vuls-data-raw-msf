By utilizing\n          this vulnerability, is possible to open a program on the server\n          (cmd.exe in our case) and type commands that will be executed as the user running\n          WiFi Mouse (Mouse Server), resulting in remote code execution.\n\n          Tested against versions 1.8.3.4 (current as of module writing) and\n          1.8.2.3.",
