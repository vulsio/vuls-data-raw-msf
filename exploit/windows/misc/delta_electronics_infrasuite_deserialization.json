  "description": "Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master versions below v1.0.5 have an\n          unauthenticated .NET deserialization vulnerability within the 'ParseUDPPacket()'\n          method of the 'Device-Gateway-Status' process.\n\n          The 'ParseUDPPacket()' method reads user-controlled packet data and eventually\n          calls 'BinaryFormatter.Deserialize()' on what it determines to be the packet header without appropriate validation,\n          leading to unauthenticated code execution as the user running the 'Device-Gateway-Status' process.",
