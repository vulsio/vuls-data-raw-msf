	"description": "Various Ricoh printer drivers allow escalation of\n          privileges on Windows systems.\n\n          For vulnerable drivers, a low-privileged user can\n          read/write files within the `RICOH_DRV` directory\n          and its subdirectories.\n\n          `PrintIsolationHost.exe`, a Windows process running\n          as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM, loads driver-specific DLLs\n          during the installation of a printer. A user can\n          elevate to SYSTEM by writing a malicious DLL to\n          the vulnerable driver directory and adding a new\n          printer with a vulnerable driver.\n\n          This module leverages the `prnmngr.vbs` script\n          to add and delete printers. Multiple runs of this\n          module may be required given successful exploitation\n          is time-sensitive.",
