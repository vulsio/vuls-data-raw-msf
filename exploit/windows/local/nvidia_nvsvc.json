	"description": "The named pipe, \\pipe\\nsvr, has a NULL DACL allowing any authenticated user to\n            interact with the service. It contains a stacked based buffer overflow as a result\n            of a memmove operation. Note the slight spelling differences: the executable is 'nvvsvc.exe',\n            the service name is 'nvsvc', and the named pipe is 'nsvr'.\n\n            This exploit automatically targets nvvsvc.exe versions dated Nov 3 2011, Aug 30 2012, and Dec 1 2012.\n            It has been tested on Windows 7 64-bit against nvvsvc.exe dated Dec 1 2012.",
