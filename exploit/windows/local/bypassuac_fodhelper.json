  "description": "This module will bypass Windows 10 UAC by hijacking a special key in the Registry under\n          the current user hive, and inserting a custom command that will get invoked when\n          the Windows fodhelper.exe application is launched. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC\n          flag turned off.\n\n          This module modifies a registry key, but cleans up the key once the payload has\n          been invoked.\n\n          The module does not require the architecture of the payload to match the OS. If\n          specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting your\n          payload in a separate process.",
