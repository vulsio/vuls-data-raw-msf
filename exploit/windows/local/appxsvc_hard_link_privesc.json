	"description": "There exists a privilege escalation vulnerability for\n          Windows 10 builds prior to build 17763. Due to the AppXSvc's\n          improper handling of hard links, a user can gain full\n          privileges over a SYSTEM-owned file. The user can then utilize\n          the new file to execute code as SYSTEM.\n\n          This module employs a technique using the Diagnostics Hub Standard\n          Collector Service (DiagHub) which was discovered by James Forshaw to\n          load and execute a DLL as SYSTEM.",
