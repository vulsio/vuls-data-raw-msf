  "description": "This module will bypass Windows UAC by hijacking a special key in the Registry under\n          the current user hive, and inserting a custom command that will get invoked when\n          Window backup and restore is launched. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC\n          flag turned off.\n\n          This module modifies a registry key, but cleans up the key once the payload has\n          been invoked.",
