	"description": "A vulnerability within the VBoxGuest driver allows an attacker to inject memory they\n            control into an arbitrary location they define. This can be used by an attacker to\n            overwrite HalDispatchTable+0x4 and execute arbitrary code by subsequently calling\n            NtQueryIntervalProfile on Windows XP SP3 systems. This has been tested with VBoxGuest\n            Additions up to 4.3.10r93012.",
