  "description": "The Windscribe VPN client application for Windows makes use of a\n          Windows service `WindscribeService.exe` which exposes a named pipe\n          `\\.\\pipe\\WindscribeService` allowing execution of programs with\n          elevated privileges.\n\n          Windscribe versions prior to 1.82 do not validate user-supplied\n          program names, allowing execution of arbitrary commands as SYSTEM.\n\n          This module has been tested successfully on Windscribe versions\n          1.80 and 1.81 on Windows 7 SP1 (x64).",
