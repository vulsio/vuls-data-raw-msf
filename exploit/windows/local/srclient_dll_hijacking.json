	"description": "All editions of Windows Server 2012 (but not 2012 R2) are vulnerable to DLL\n          hijacking due to the way TiWorker.exe will try to call the non-existent\n          `SrClient.dll` file when Windows Update checks for updates. This issue can be\n          leveraged for privilege escalation if %PATH% includes directories that are\n          writable by low-privileged users. The attack can be triggered by any\n          low-privileged user and does not require a system reboot.\n\n          This module has been successfully tested on Windows Server 2012 (x64).",
