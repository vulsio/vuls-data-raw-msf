  "description": "Due to a problem with isolating window broadcast messages in the Windows kernel,\n          an attacker can broadcast commands from a lower Integrity Level process to a\n          higher Integrity Level process, thereby effecting a privilege escalation. This\n          issue affects Windows Vista, 7, 8, Server 2008, Server 2008 R2, Server 2012, and\n          RT. Note that spawning a command prompt with the shortcut key combination Win+Shift+#\n          does not work in Vista, so the attacker will have to check if the user is already\n          running a command prompt and set SPAWN_PROMPT false.\n\n          Three exploit techniques are available with this module. The WEB technique will\n          execute a powershell encoded payload from a Web location.  The FILE technique\n          will drop an executable to the file system, set it to medium integrity and execute\n          it. The TYPE technique will attempt to execute a powershell encoded payload directly\n          from the command line, but may take some time to complete.",
