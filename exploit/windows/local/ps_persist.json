  "description": "This module generates a dynamic executable on the session host using .NET templates.\n          Code is pulled from C# templates and impregnated with a payload before being\n          sent to a modified PowerShell session with .NET 4 loaded. The compiler builds\n          the executable (standard or Windows service) in memory and produces a binary\n          which can be started/installed and downloaded for later use. After compilation the\n          PoweShell session can also sign the executable if provided a path the a .pfx formatted\n          certificate.",
