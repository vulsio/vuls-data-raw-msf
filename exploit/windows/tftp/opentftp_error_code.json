	"description": "This module exploits a buffer overflow in OpenTFTP Server SP 1.4.  The vulnerable\n        condition triggers when the TFTP opcode is configured as an error packet, the TFTP\n        service will then format the message using a sprintf() function, which causes an\n        overflow, therefore allowing remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM.\n\n          The offset (to EIP) is specific to how the TFTP was started (as a 'Stand Alone',\n        or 'Service').  By default the target is set to 'Service' because that's the default\n        configuration during OpenTFTP Server SP 1.4's installation.",
