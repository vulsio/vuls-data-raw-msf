  "description": "This module exploits a remote command-injection vulnerability in EMC Replication Manager\n        client (irccd.exe). By sending a specially crafted message invoking RunProgram function an\n        attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges. Affected\n        products are EMC Replication Manager < 5.3. This module has been successfully tested\n        against EMC Replication Manager 5.2.1 on XP/W2003. EMC Networker Module for Microsoft\n        Applications 2.1 and 2.2 may be vulnerable too although this module have not been tested\n        against these products.",
