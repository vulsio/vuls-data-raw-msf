	"description": "This module can be used to execute arbitrary commands on IIS servers\n          that expose the /msadc/msadcs.dll Microsoft Data Access Components\n          (MDAC) Remote Data Service (RDS) DataFactory service using VbBusObj\n          or AdvancedDataFactory to inject shell commands into Microsoft Access\n          databases (MDBs), MSSQL databases and ODBC/JET Data Source Name (DSN).\n          Based on the msadcs.pl v2 exploit by Rain.Forest.Puppy, which was actively\n          used in the wild in the late Ninties. MDAC versions affected include MDAC\n          1.5, 2.0, 2.0 SDK, 2.1 and systems with the MDAC Sample Pages for RDS\n          installed, and NT4 Servers with the NT Option Pack installed or upgraded\n          2000 systems often running IIS3/4/5 however some vulnerable installations\n          can still be found on newer Windows operating systems. Note that newer\n          releases of msadcs.dll can still be abused however by default remote\n          connections to the RDS is denied. Consider using VERBOSE if you're unable\n          to successfully execute a command, as the error messages are detailed\n          and useful for debugging. Also set NAME to obtain the remote hostname,\n          and METHOD to use the alternative VbBusObj technique.",
