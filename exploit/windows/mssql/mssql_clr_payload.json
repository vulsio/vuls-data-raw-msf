	"description": "This module executes an arbitrary native payload on a Microsoft SQL\n        server by loading a custom SQL CLR Assembly into the target SQL\n        installation, and calling it directly with a base64-encoded payload.\n\n        The module requires working credentials in order to connect directly to the\n        MSSQL Server.\n\n        This method requires the user to have sufficient privileges to install a custom\n        SQL CRL DLL, and invoke the custom stored procedure that comes with it.\n\n        This exploit does not leave any binaries on disk.\n\n        Tested on MS SQL Server versions: 2005, 2012, 2016 (all x64).",
