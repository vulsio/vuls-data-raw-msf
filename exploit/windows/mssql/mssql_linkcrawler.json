	"description": "This module can be used to crawl MS SQL Server database links and deploy\n        Metasploit payloads through links configured with sysadmin privileges using a\n        valid SQL Server Login.\n\n          If you are attempting to obtain multiple reverse shells using this module we\n        recommend setting the \"DisablePayloadHandler\" advanced option to \"true\", and setting\n        up a exploit/multi/handler to run in the background as a job to support multiple incoming\n        shells.\n\n          If you are interested in deploying payloads to specific servers this module also\n        supports that functionality via the \"DEPLOYLIST\" option.\n\n          Currently, the module is capable of delivering payloads to both 32bit and 64bit\n        Windows systems via powershell memory injection methods based on Matthew Graeber's\n        work. As a result, the target server must have powershell installed. By default,\n        all of the crawl information is saved to a CSV formatted log file and MSF loot so\n        that the tool can also be used for auditing without deploying payloads.",
