  "description": "This module will exploit SMB with vulnerabilities in MS17-010 to achieve a write-what-where\n        primitive. This will then be used to overwrite the connection session information with as an\n        Administrator session. From there, the normal psexec payload code execution is done.\n\n        Exploits a type confusion between Transaction and WriteAndX requests and a race condition in\n        Transaction requests, as seen in the EternalRomance, EternalChampion, and EternalSynergy\n        exploits. This exploit chain is more reliable than the EternalBlue exploit, but requires a\n        named pipe.",
