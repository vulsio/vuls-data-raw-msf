  "description": "This module exploits a registry-based stack buffer overflow in the Windows Routing\n        and Remote Access Service. Since the service is hosted inside svchost.exe,\n        a failed exploit attempt can cause other system services to fail as well.\n        A valid username and password is required to exploit this flaw on Windows 2000.\n        When attacking XP SP1, the SMBPIPE option needs to be set to 'SRVSVC'.\n        Exploiting this flaw involves two distinct steps - creating the registry key\n        and then triggering an overwrite based on a read of this key. Once the key is\n        created, it cannot be recreated. This means that for any given system, you\n        only get one chance to exploit this flaw. Picking the wrong target will require\n        a manual removal of the following registry key before you can try again:\n        HKEY_USERS\\.DEFAULT\\Software\\Microsoft\\RAS Phonebook",
