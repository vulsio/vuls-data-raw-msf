  "description": "The GenBroker service on port 38080 is affected by three integer overflow\n        vulnerabilities while handling opcode 0x4b0, which is caused by abusing the\n        the memory allocations needed for the number of elements passed by the client.\n        This results unexpected behaviors such as direct registry calls, memory location\n        calls, or arbitrary remote code execution.  Please note that in order to ensure\n        reliability, this exploit will try to open calc (hidden), inject itself into the\n        process, and then open up a shell session.  Also, DEP bypass is supported.",
