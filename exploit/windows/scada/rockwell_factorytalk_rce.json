	"description": "This module exploits a series of vulnerabilities to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution\n          on the Rockwell FactoryTalk View SE SCADA product as the IIS user.\n          The attack relies on the chaining of five separate vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability is an unauthenticated project copy request,\n          the second is a directory traversal, and the third is a race condition. In order to achieve full remote code execution on all\n          targets, two information leak vulnerabilities are also abused.\n          This exploit was used by the Flashback team (Pedro Ribeiro + Radek Domanski) in Pwn2Own Miami 2020 to win the EWS category.",
