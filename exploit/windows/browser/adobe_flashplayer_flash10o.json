	"description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player that was discovered,\n        and has been exploited actively in the wild.  By embedding a specially crafted .swf\n        file, Adobe Flash crashes due to an invalid use of an object type, which allows\n        attackers to overwrite a pointer in memory, and results arbitrary code execution.\n        Please note for IE 8 targets, Java Runtime Environment must be available on the\n        victim machine in order to work properly.",
