	"description": "This module abuses the Color Management classes from a Java Applet to run\n        arbitrary Java code outside of the sandbox as exploited in the wild in February\n        and March of 2013. The vulnerability affects Java version 7u15 and earlier and 6u41\n        and earlier and has been tested successfully on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1\n        systems. This exploit doesn't bypass click-to-play, so the user must accept the java\n        warning in order to run the malicious applet.",
