	"description": "This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability found in Internet Explorer. The flaw\n        was most likely introduced in 2013, therefore only certain builds of MSHTML are\n        affected. In our testing with IE9, these vulnerable builds appear to be between\n        9.0.8112.16496 and 9.0.8112.16533, which implies the vulnerability shipped between\n        August 2013, when it was introduced, until the fix issued in early March 2014.",
