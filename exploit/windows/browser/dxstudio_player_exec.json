	"description": "This module exploits a command execution vulnerability within the DX\n        Studio Player from Worldweaver for versions 3.0.29 and earlier. The\n        player is a browser plugin for IE (ActiveX) and Firefox (dll). When an\n        unsuspecting user visits a web page referring to a specially crafted\n        .dxstudio document, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands.\n\n        Testing was conducted using plugin version 3.0.29.0 for Firefox 2.0.0.20\n        and IE 6 on Windows XP SP3. In IE, the user will be prompted if they\n        wish to allow the plug-in to access local files. This prompt appears to\n        occur only once per server host.\n\n        NOTE: This exploit uses additionally dangerous script features to write\n        to local files!",
