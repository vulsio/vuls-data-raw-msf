	"description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in Ultra Shareware's Office\n        Control. When processing the 'HttpUpload' method, the arguments are concatenated\n        together to form a command line to run a bundled version of cURL. If the command\n        fails to run, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs when building the error\n        message. This is due to the use of sprintf() without proper bounds checking.\n\n        NOTE: Due to input restrictions, this exploit uses a heap-spray to get the payload\n        into memory unmodified.",
