  "description": "This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in the tsgetx71ex553.dll\n        ActiveX control installed with Tom Sawyer GET Extension Factory due to an incorrect\n        initialization under Internet Explorer.\n\n        While the Tom Sawyer GET Extension Factory is installed with some versions of VMware\n        Infrastructure Client, this module has been tested only with the versions installed\n        with Embarcadero Technologies ER/Studio XE2 / Embarcadero Studio Portal 1.6. The ActiveX\n        control tested is tsgetx71ex553.dll, version 5.5.3.238.\n\n        This module achieves DEP and ASLR bypass using the well known msvcr71.dll rop chain. The\n        dll is installed by default with the Embarcadero software, and loaded by the targeted\n        ActiveX.",
