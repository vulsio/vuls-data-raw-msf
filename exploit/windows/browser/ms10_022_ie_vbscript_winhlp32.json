	"description": "This module exploits a code execution vulnerability that occurs when a user\n        presses F1 on MessageBox originated from VBscript within a web page. When the\n        user hits F1, the MessageBox help functionality will attempt to load and use\n        a HLP file from an SMB or WebDAV (if the WebDAV redirector is enabled) server.\n\n        This particular version of the exploit implements a WebDAV server that will\n        serve HLP file as well as a payload EXE. During testing warnings about the\n        payload EXE being unsigned were witnessed. A future version of this module\n        might use other methods that do not create such a warning.",
