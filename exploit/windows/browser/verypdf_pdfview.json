  "description": "The VeryPDF PDFView ActiveX control is prone to a heap buffer-overflow\n        because it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied data before copying\n        it into an insufficiently sized memory buffer. An attacker can exploit this issue\n        to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application.",
