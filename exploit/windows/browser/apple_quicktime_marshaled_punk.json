	"description": "This module exploits a memory trust issue in Apple QuickTime\n        7.6.7. When processing a specially-crafted HTML page, the QuickTime ActiveX\n        control will treat a supplied parameter as a trusted pointer. It will\n        then use it as a COM-type pUnknown and lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n        This exploit utilizes a combination of heap spraying and the\n        QuickTimeAuthoring.qtx module to bypass DEP and ASLR. This module does not\n        opt-in to ASLR. As such, this module should be reliable on all Windows\n        versions.\n\n        NOTE: The addresses may need to be adjusted for older versions of QuickTime.",
