	"description": "This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the\n        LoadAniIcon() function in USER32.dll. The flaw can be triggered through\n        Internet Explorer 6 and 7 by using the CURSOR style sheet directive\n        to load a malicious .ANI file. The module can also exploit Mozilla\n        Firefox by using a UNC path in a moz-icon URL and serving the .ANI file\n        over WebDAV. The vulnerable code in USER32.dll will catch any\n        exceptions that occur while the invalid cursor is loaded, causing the\n        exploit to silently fail when the wrong target has been chosen.\n\n        This vulnerability was discovered by Alexander Sotirov of Determina\n        and was rediscovered, in the wild, by McAfee.",
