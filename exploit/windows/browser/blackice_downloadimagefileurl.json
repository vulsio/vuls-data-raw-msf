  "description": "This module allows remote attackers to place arbitrary files on a users file system\n        by abusing the \"DownloadImageFileURL\" method in the Black Ice BIImgFrm.ocx ActiveX\n        Control (BIImgFrm.ocx 12.0.0.0).  Code execution can be achieved by first uploading the\n        payload to the remote machine, and then upload another mof file, which enables Windows\n        Management Instrumentation service to execute the binary. Please note that this module\n        currently only works for Windows before Vista.  Also, a similar issue is reported in\n        BIDIB.ocx (10.9.3.0) within the Barcode SDK.",
