  "description": "This module exploits a flaw within the handling of MixerSequencer objects\n        in Java 6u18 and before.\n\n          Exploitation id done by supplying a specially crafted MIDI file within an RMF\n        File. When the MixerSequencer objects is used to play the file, the GM_Song\n        structure is populated with a function pointer provided by a SONG block in the\n        RMF. A Midi block that contains a MIDI with a specially crafted controller event\n        is used to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n        When triggering the vulnerability \"ebx\" points to a fake event in the MIDI file\n        which stores the shellcode. A \"jmp ebx\" from msvcr71.dll is used to make the\n        exploit reliable over java updates.",
