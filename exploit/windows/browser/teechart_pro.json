	"description": "This module exploits an integer overflow in TeeChart Pro ActiveX control. When\n        sending an overly large/negative integer value to the AddSeries() property of\n        TeeChart2010.ocx, the code will perform an arithmetic operation that wraps the\n        value and is later directly trusted and called upon.\n\n        This module has been designed to bypass DEP only under IE8 with Java support. Multiple\n        versions (including the latest version) are affected by this vulnerability that date\n        back to as far as 2001.\n\n        The following controls are vulnerable:\n\n        TeeChart5.ocx Version 5.0.1.0 (clsid: B6C10489-FB89-11D4-93C9-006008A7EED4);\n        TeeChart6.ocx Version 6.0.0.5 (clsid: 536600D3-70FE-4C50-92FB-640F6BFC49AD);\n        TeeChart7.ocx Version 7.0.1.4 (clsid: FAB9B41C-87D6-474D-AB7E-F07D78F2422E);\n        TeeChart8.ocx Version 8.0.0.8 (clsid: BDEB0088-66F9-4A55-ABD2-0BF8DEEC1196);\n        TeeChart2010.ocx Version 2010.0.0.3 (clsid: FCB4B50A-E3F1-4174-BD18-54C3B3287258).\n\n        The controls are deployed under several SCADA based systems including:\n\n        Unitronics OPC server v1.3;\n        BACnet Operator Workstation Version 1.0.76",
