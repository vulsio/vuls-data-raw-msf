	"description": "Inject a custom native PE file into the exploited process using a reflective PE loader. The reflective PE\nloader will execute the pre-mapped PE image starting from the address of entry after performing image base\nrelocation and API address resolution. This module requires a PE file that contains relocation data and a\nvalid (uncorrupted) import table. PE files with CLR(C#/.NET executables), bounded imports, and TLS callbacks\nare not currently supported. Also PE files which use resource loading might crash.\nListen for an IPv6 connection with UUID Support (Windows x64)",
