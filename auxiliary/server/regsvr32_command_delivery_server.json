	"description": "This module uses the Regsvr32.exe Application Whitelisting Bypass technique as a way to run a command on\n        a target system. The major advantage of this technique is that you can execute a static command on the target\n        system and dynamically and remotely change the command that will actually run (by changing the value of CMD).\n        This is useful when combined with persistence methods (e.g., a recurring scheduled task) or when flexibility\n        is needed through the use of a single command (e.g., as Rubber Ducky payload).",
