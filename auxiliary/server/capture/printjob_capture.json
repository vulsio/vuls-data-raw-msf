  "description": "This module is designed to listen for PJL or PostScript print\n        jobs. Once a print job is detected it is saved to loot. The\n        captured printjob can then be forwarded on to another printer\n        (required for LPR printjobs). Resulting PCL/PS files can be\n        read with GhostScript/GhostPCL.\n\n        Note, this module does not yet support IPP connections.",
