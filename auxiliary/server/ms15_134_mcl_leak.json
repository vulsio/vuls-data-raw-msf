  "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Windows Media Center. It allows an MCL\n        file to render itself as an HTML document in the local machine zone by Internet Explorer,\n        which can be used to leak files on the target machine.\n\n        Please be aware that if this exploit is used against a patched Windows, it can cause the\n        computer to be very slow or unresponsive (100% CPU). It seems to be related to how the\n        exploit uses the URL attribute in order to render itself as an HTML file.",
