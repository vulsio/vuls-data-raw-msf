  "description": "This module provides a Rex based DNS service which can store static entries,\n        resolve names over pivots, and serve DNS requests across routed session comms.\n        DNS tunnels can operate across the Rex switchboard, and DNS other modules\n        can use this as a template. Setting static records via hostfile allows for DNS\n        spoofing attacks without direct traffic manipulation at the handlers. handlers\n        for requests and responses provided here mimic the internal Rex functionality,\n        but utilize methods within this module's namespace to output content processed\n        in the Proc contexts via vprint_status.",
