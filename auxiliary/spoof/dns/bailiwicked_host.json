  "description": "This exploit attacks a fairly ubiquitous flaw in DNS implementations which\n        Dan Kaminsky found and disclosed ~Jul 2008.  This exploit caches a single\n        malicious host entry into the target nameserver by sending random hostname\n        queries to the target DNS server coupled with spoofed replies to those\n        queries from the authoritative nameservers for that domain. Eventually, a\n        guessed ID will match, the spoofed packet will get accepted, and due to the\n        additional hostname entry being within bailiwick constraints of the original\n        request the malicious host entry will get cached.",
