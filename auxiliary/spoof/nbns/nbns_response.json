	"description": "This module forges NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) responses. It will listen for NBNS requests\n          sent to the local subnet's broadcast address and spoof a response, redirecting the querying\n          machine to an IP of the attacker's choosing. Combined with auxiliary/server/capture/smb or\n          auxiliary/server/capture/http_ntlm it is a highly effective means of collecting crackable hashes on\n          common networks.\n\n          This module must be run as root and will bind to udp/137 on all interfaces.",
