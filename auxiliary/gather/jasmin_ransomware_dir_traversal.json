	"description": "The Jasmin Ransomware web server contains an unauthenticated directory traversal vulnerability\n          within the download functionality. As of April 15, 2024 this was still unpatched, so all\n          versions are vulnerable. The last patch was in 2021, so it will likely not ever be patched.",
