	"description": "The W3-Total-Cache Wordpress Plugin <= 0.9.2.4 can cache database statements\n        and its results in files for fast access. Version 0.9.2.4 has been fixed afterwards\n        so it can be vulnerable. These cache files are in the webroot of the Wordpress\n        installation and can be downloaded if the name is guessed. This module tries to\n        locate them with brute force in order to find usernames and password hashes in these\n        files. W3 Total Cache must be configured with Database Cache enabled and Database\n        Cache Method set to Disk to be vulnerable",
