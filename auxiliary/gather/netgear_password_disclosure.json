  "description": "This module will collect the password for the `admin` user.\n        The exploit will not complete if password recovery is set on the router.\n        The password is received by passing the token generated from `unauth.cgi`\n        to `passwordrecovered.cgi`. This exploit works on many different NETGEAR\n        products. The full list of affected products is available in the 'References'\n        section.",
