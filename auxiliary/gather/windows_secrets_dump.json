	"description": "Dumps SAM hashes and LSA secrets (including cached creds) from the\n          remote Windows target without executing any agent locally. First, it\n          reads as much data as possible from the registry and then save the\n          hives locally on the target (%SYSTEMROOT%\\Temp\\random.tmp). Finally, it\n          downloads the temporary hive files and reads the rest of the data\n          from it. This temporary files are removed when it's done.\n\n          On domain controllers, secrets from Active Directory is extracted\n          using [MS-DRDS] DRSGetNCChanges(), replicating the attributes we need\n          to get SIDs, NTLM hashes, groups, password history, Kerberos keys and\n          other interesting data. Note that the actual `NTDS.dit` file is not\n          downloaded. Instead, the Directory Replication Service directly asks\n          Active Directory through RPC requests.\n\n          This modules takes care of starting or enabling the Remote Registry\n          service if needed. It will restore the service to its original state\n          when it's done.\n\n          This is a port of the great Impacket `secretsdump.py` code written by\n          Alberto Solino.",
