	"description": "Dumps SAM hashes and LSA secrets (including cached creds) from the\n          remote Windows target without executing any agent locally. This is\n          done by remotely updating the registry key security descriptor,\n          taking advantage of the WriteDACL privileges held by local\n          administrators to set temporary read permissions.\n\n          This can be disabled by setting the `INLINE` option to false and the\n          module will fallback to the original implementation, which consists\n          in saving the registry hives locally on the target\n          (%SYSTEMROOT%\\Temp\\<random>.tmp), downloading the temporary hive\n          files and reading the data from it. This temporary files are removed\n          when it's done.\n\n          On domain controllers, secrets from Active Directory is extracted\n          using [MS-DRDS] DRSGetNCChanges(), replicating the attributes we need\n          to get SIDs, NTLM hashes, groups, password history, Kerberos keys and\n          other interesting data. Note that the actual `NTDS.dit` file is not\n          downloaded. Instead, the Directory Replication Service directly asks\n          Active Directory through RPC requests.\n\n          This modules takes care of starting or enabling the Remote Registry\n          service if needed. It will restore the service to its original state\n          when it's done.\n\n          This is a port of the great Impacket `secretsdump.py` code written by\n          Alberto Solino.",
