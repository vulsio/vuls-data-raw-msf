  "description": "This module will extract Domain Controller credentials from vulnerable installations of HP\n        SNAC as distributed with HP ProCurve 4.00 and 3.20. The authentication bypass vulnerability\n        has been used to exploit remote file uploads. This vulnerability can be used to gather important\n        information handled by the vulnerable application, like plain text domain controller\n        credentials. This module has been tested successfully with HP SNAC included with ProCurve\n        Manager 4.0.",
