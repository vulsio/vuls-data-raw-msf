  "description": "Nuuo Central Management Server below version 2.4 has a flaw where it sends the\n        heap address of the user object instead of a real session number when a user logs\n        in. This can be used to reduce the keyspace for the session number from 10 million\n        to 1.2 million, and with a bit of analysis it can be guessed in less than 500k tries.\n        This module does exactly that - it uses a computed occurence table to try the most common\n        combinations up to 1.2 million to try to guess a valid user session.\n        This session number can then be used to achieve code execution or download files - see\n        the other Nuuo CMS auxiliary and exploit modules.\n        Note that for this to work a user has to be logged into the system.",
