	"description": "This module utilizes the Jenkins cli protocol to run the `help` command.\n          The cli is accessible with read-only permissions by default, which are\n          all thats required.\n\n          Jenkins cli utilizes `args4j's` `parseArgument`, which calls `expandAtFiles` to\n          replace any `@<filename>` with the contents of a file. We are then able to retrieve\n          the error message to read up to the first two lines of a file.\n\n          Exploitation by hand can be done with the cli, see markdown documents for additional\n          instructions.\n\n          There are a few exploitation oddities:\n          1. The injection point for the `help` command requires 2 input arguments.\n          When the `expandAtFiles` is called, each line of the `FILE_PATH` becomes an input argument.\n          If a file only contains one line, it will throw an error: `ERROR: You must authenticate to access this Jenkins.`\n          However, we can pad out the content by supplying a first argument.\n          2. There is a strange timing requirement where the `download` (or first) request must get\n          to the server first, but the `upload` (or second) request must be very close behind it.\n          From testing against the docker image, it was found values between `.01` and `1.9` were\n          viable. Due to the round trip time of the first request and response happening before\n          request 2 would be received, it is necessary to use threading to ensure the requests\n          happen within rapid succession.\n\n          Files of value:\n          * /var/jenkins_home/secret.key\n          * /var/jenkins_home/secrets/master.key\n          * /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword\n          * /etc/passwd\n          * /etc/shadow\n          * Project secrets and credentials\n          * Source code, build artifacts",
