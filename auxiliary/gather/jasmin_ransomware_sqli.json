	"description": "The Jasmin Ransomware web server contains an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability\n          within the login functionality. As of April 15, 2024 this was still unpatched, so all\n          versions are vulnerable. The last patch was in 2021, so it will likely not ever be patched.\n\n          Retrieving the victim's data may take a long amount of time. It is much quicker to\n          get the logins, then just login to the site.",
