	"description": "This module sends a query to the port 264/TCP on CheckPoint Firewall-1\n        firewalls to obtain the firewall name and management station\n        (such as SmartCenter) name via a pre-authentication request. The string\n        returned is the CheckPoint Internal CA CN for SmartCenter and the firewall\n        host. Whilst considered \"public\" information, the majority of installations\n        use detailed hostnames which may aid an attacker in focusing on compromising\n        the SmartCenter host, or useful for government, intelligence and military\n        networks where the hostname reveals the physical location and rack number\n        of the device, which may be unintentionally published to the world.",
