	"description": "It was found that Internet Explorer allows the disclosure of local file names.\n        This issue exists due to the fact that Internet Explorer behaves different for\n        file:// URLs pointing to existing and non-existent files. When used in\n        combination with HTML5 sandbox iframes it is possible to use this behavior to\n        find out if a local file exists. This technique only works on Internet Explorer\n        10 & 11 since these support the HTML5 sandbox. Also it is not possible to do\n        this from a regular website as file:// URLs are blocked all together. The attack\n        must be performed locally (works with Internet zone Mark of the Web) or from a\n        share.",
