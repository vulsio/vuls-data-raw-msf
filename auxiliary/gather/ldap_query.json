	"description": "This module allows users to query an LDAP server using either a custom LDAP query, or\n          a set of LDAP queries under a specific category. Users can also specify a JSON or YAML\n          file containing custom queries to be executed using the RUN_QUERY_FILE action.\n          If this action is specified, then QUERY_FILE_PATH must be a path to the location\n          of this JSON/YAML file on disk.\n\n          Users can also run a single query by using the RUN_SINGLE_QUERY option and then setting\n          the QUERY_FILTER datastore option to the filter to send to the LDAP server and QUERY_ATTRIBUTES\n          to a comma separated string containing the list of attributes they are interested in obtaining\n          from the results.\n\n          As a third option can run one of several predefined queries by setting ACTION to the\n          appropriate value. These options will be loaded from the ldap_queries_default.yaml file\n          located in the MSF configuration directory, located by default at ~/.msf4/ldap_queries_default.yaml.\n\n          All results will be returned to the user in table, CSV or JSON format, depending on the value\n          of the OUTPUT_FORMAT datastore option. The characters || will be used as a delimiter\n          should multiple items exist within a single column.",
