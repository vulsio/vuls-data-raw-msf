	"description": "This module binds to an open X11 host to log keystrokes. This is a fairly\n          close copy of the old xspy c program which has been on Kali for a long time.\n          The module works by connecting to the X11 session, creating a background\n          window, binding a keyboard to it and creating a notification alert when a key\n          is pressed.\n\n          One of the major limitations of xspy, and thus this module, is that it polls\n          at a very fast rate, faster than a key being pressed is released (especially before\n          the repeat delay is hit). To combat printing multiple characters for a single key\n          press, repeat characters arent printed when typed in a very fast manor. This is also\n          an imperfect keylogger in that keystrokes arent stored and forwarded but status\n          displayed at poll time. Keys may be repeated or missing.",
