	"description": "This module continuously spams NetBIOS responses to a target for given hostname,\n        causing the target to cache a malicious address for this name. On high-speed local\n        networks, the PPSRATE value should be increased to speed up this attack. As an\n        example, a value of around 30,000 is almost 100% successful when spoofing a\n        response for a 'WPAD' lookup. Distant targets may require more time and lower\n        rates for a successful attack.",
