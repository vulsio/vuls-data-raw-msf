	"description": "This module can be used to help capture or relay the LM/NTLM credentials of the\n        account running the remote SQL Server service. The module will use the SQL\n        injection from GET_PATH to connect to the target SQL Server instance and execute\n        the native \"xp_dirtree\" or stored procedure.   The stored procedures will then\n        force the service account to authenticate to the system defined in the SMBProxy\n        option. In order for the attack to be successful, the SMB capture or relay module\n        must be running on the system defined as the SMBProxy. The database account used to\n        connect to the database should only require the \"PUBLIC\" role to execute.\n        Successful execution of this attack usually results in local administrative access\n        to the Windows system.  Specifically, this works great for relaying credentials\n        between two SQL Servers using a shared service account to get shells.  However, if\n        the relay fails, then the LM hash can be reversed using the Halflm rainbow tables\n        and john the ripper.",
