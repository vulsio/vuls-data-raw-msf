	"description": "This module will exploit SMB with vulnerabilities in MS17-010 to achieve a write-what-where\n          primitive. This will then be used to overwrite the connection session information with as an\n           Administrator session. From there, the normal psexec command execution is done.\n\n          Exploits a type confusion between Transaction and WriteAndX requests and a race condition in\n          Transaction requests, as seen in the EternalRomance, EternalChampion, and EternalSynergy\n          exploits. This exploit chain is more reliable than the EternalBlue exploit, but requires a\n          named pipe.",
