	"description": "This module authenticates to an Active Directory Domain Controller and creates\n        a volume shadow copy of the %SYSTEMDRIVE%. It then pulls down copies of the\n        ntds.dit file as well as the SYSTEM hive and stores them. The ntds.dit and SYSTEM\n        hive copy can be used in combination with other tools for offline extraction of AD\n        password hashes. All of this is done without uploading a single binary to the\n        target host.",
