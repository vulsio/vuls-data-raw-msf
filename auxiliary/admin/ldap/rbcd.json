  "description": "This module can read and write the necessary LDAP attributes to configure a particular object for Role Based\n          Constrained Delegation (RBCD). When writing, the module will add an access control entry to allow the account\n          specified in DELEGATE_FROM to the object specified in DELEGATE_TO. In order for this to succeed, the\n          authenticated user must have write access to the target object (the object specified in DELEGATE_TO).",
