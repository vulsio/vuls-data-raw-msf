  "description": "The WordPress WP EasyCart plugin from version 1.1.30 to 3.0.20 allows authenticated\n          users of any user level to set any system option via a lack of validation in the\n          ec_ajax_update_option and ec_ajax_clear_all_taxrates functions located in\n          /inc/admin/admin_ajax_functions.php. The module first changes the admin e-mail address\n          to prevent any notifications being sent to the actual administrator during the attack,\n          re-enables user registration in case it has been disabled and sets the default role to\n          be administrator. This will allow for the user to create a new account with admin\n          privileges via the default registration page found at /wp-login.php?action=register.",
