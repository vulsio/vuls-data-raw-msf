	"description": "IBM Data Risk Manager (IDRM) contains two vulnerabilities that can be chained by\n          an unauthenticated attacker to download arbitrary files off the system.\n          The first is an unauthenticated bypass, followed by a path traversal.\n          This module exploits both vulnerabilities, giving an attacker the ability to download (non-root) files.\n          A downloaded file is zipped, and this module also unzips it before storing it in the database.\n          By default this module downloads Tomcat's application.properties files, which contains the\n          database password, amongst other sensitive data.\n          At the time of disclosure, this is was a 0 day, but IBM later patched it and released their advisory.\n          Versions 2.0.2 to 2.0.4 are vulnerable, version 2.0.1 is not.",
