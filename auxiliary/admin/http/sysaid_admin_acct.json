	"description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in SysAid Help Desk that allows an unauthenticated\n          user to create an administrator account. Note that this exploit will only work once. Any\n          subsequent attempts will fail. On the other hand, the credentials must be verified\n          manually. This module has been tested on SysAid 14.4 in Windows and Linux.",
