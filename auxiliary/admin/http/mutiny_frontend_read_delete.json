	"description": "This module exploits the EditDocument servlet from the frontend on the Mutiny 5\n          appliance. The EditDocument servlet provides file operations, such as copy and\n          delete, which are affected by a directory traversal vulnerability. Because of this,\n          any authenticated frontend user can read and delete arbitrary files from the system\n          with root privileges. In order to exploit the vulnerability a valid user (any role)\n          in the web frontend is required. The module has been tested successfully on the\n          Mutiny 5.0-1.07 appliance.",
