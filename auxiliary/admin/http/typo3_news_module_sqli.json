	"description": "This module exploits a SQL Injection vulnerability In TYPO3 NewsController.php\n          in the news module 5.3.2 and earlier. It allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary\n          SQL commands via vectors involving overwriteDemand and OrderByAllowed. The SQL injection\n          can be used to obtain password hashes for application user accounts. This module has been\n          tested on TYPO3 3.16.0 running news extension 5.0.0.\n\n          This module tries to extract username and password hash of the administrator user.\n          It tries to inject sql and check every letter of a pattern, to see\n          if it belongs to the username or password it tries to alter the ordering of results. If\n          the letter doesn't belong to the word being extracted then all results are inverted\n          (News #2 appears before News #1, so Pattern2 before Pattern1), instead if the letter belongs\n          to the word being extracted then the results are in proper order (News #1 appears before News #2,\n          so Pattern1 before Pattern2)",
