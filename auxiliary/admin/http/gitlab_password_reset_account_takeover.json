	"description": "This module exploits an account-take-over vulnerability that allows users\n        to take control of a gitlab account without user interaction.\n\n        The vulnerability lies in the password reset functionality. Its possible to provide 2 emails\n        and the reset code will be sent to both. It is therefore possible to provide the e-mail\n        address of the target account as well as that of one we control, and to reset the password.\n\n        2-factor authentication prevents this vulnerability from being exploitable. There is no\n        discernable difference between a vulnerable and non-vulnerable server response.\n\n        Vulnerable versions include:\n        16.1 < 16.1.6,\n        16.2 < 16.2.9,\n        16.3 < 16.3.7,\n        16.4 < 16.4.5,\n        16.5 < 16.5.6,\n        16.6 < 16.6.4,\n        and 16.7 < 16.7.2.",
