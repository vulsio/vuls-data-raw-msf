  "description": "Some Linksys Routers are vulnerable to OS Command injection.\n          You will need credentials to the web interface to access the vulnerable part\n          of the application.\n          Default credentials are always a good starting point. admin/admin or admin\n          and blank password could be a first try.\n          Note: This is a blind OS command injection vulnerability. This means that\n          you will not see any output of your command. Try a ping command to your\n          local system and observe the packets with tcpdump (or equivalent) for a first test.\n\n          Hint: To get a remote shell you could upload a netcat binary and exec it.\n          WARNING: this module will overwrite network and DHCP configuration.",
