  "description": "This module exploits two vulnerabilities in SysAid Help Desk that allows\n          an unauthenticated user to download arbitrary files from the system. First, an\n          information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2015-2997) is used to obtain the file\n          system path, and then we abuse a directory traversal (CVE-2015-2996) to download\n          the file. Note that there are some limitations on Windows, in that the information\n          disclosure vulnerability doesn't work on a Windows platform, and we can only\n          traverse the current drive (if you enter C:\\afile.txt and the server is running\n          on D:\\ the file will not be downloaded).\n\n          This module has been tested with SysAid 14.4 on Windows and Linux.",
