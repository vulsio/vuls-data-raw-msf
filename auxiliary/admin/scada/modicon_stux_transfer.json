	"description": "The Schneider Modicon with Unity series of PLCs use Modbus function\n        code 90 (0x5a) to send and receive ladder logic.  The protocol is\n        unauthenticated, and allows a rogue host to retrieve the existing\n        logic and to upload new logic.\n\n        Two modes are supported: \"SEND\" and \"RECV,\" which behave as one might\n        expect -- use 'set mode ACTIONAME' to use either mode of operation.\n\n        In either mode, FILENAME must be set to a valid path to an existing\n        file (for SENDing) or a new file (for RECVing), and the directory must\n        already exist.  The default, 'modicon_ladder.apx' is a blank\n        ladder logic file which can be used for testing.\n\n        This module is based on the original 'modiconstux.rb' Basecamp module from\n        DigitalBond.",
