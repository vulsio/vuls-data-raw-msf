	"description": "This module tests for a logic vulnerability in the Cisco VPN Concentrator\n          3000 series. It is possible to execute some FTP statements without authentication\n          (CWD, RNFR, MKD, RMD, SIZE, CDUP). It also appears to have some memory leak bugs\n          when working with CWD commands. This module simply creates an arbitrary directory,\n          verifies that the directory has been created, then deletes it and verifies deletion\n          to confirm the bug.",
