	"description": "This module exploits the CVE-2020-6207 vulnerability within the SAP EEM servlet (tc~smd~agent~application~eem) of\n          SAP Solution Manager (SolMan) running version 7.2. The vulnerability occurs due to missing authentication\n          checks when submitting SOAP requests to the /EemAdminService/EemAdmin page to get information about connected SMDAgents,\n          send HTTP request (SSRF), and execute OS commands on connected SMDAgent. Works stable in connected SMDAgent with Java version 1.8.\n\n          Successful exploitation of the vulnerability enables unauthenticated remote attackers to achieve SSRF and execute OS commands from the agent connected\n          to SolMan as a user from which the SMDAgent service starts, usually the daaadm.",
