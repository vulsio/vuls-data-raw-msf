	"description": "This module can be used to read the stored password of a vulnerable\n      Apple Airport Extreme access point. Only a small number of firmware versions\n      have the WDBRPC service running, however the factory configuration was\n      vulnerable. It appears that firmware versions 5.0.x as well as 5.1.x are\n      susceptible to this issue. Once the password is obtained, the access point\n      can be managed using the Apple AirPort utility.",
