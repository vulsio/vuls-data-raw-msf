	"description": "This module exploits a buffer underrun vulnerability in Microsoft's DNSAPI.dll\n        as distributed with Windows Vista and later without KB2509553. By sending a\n        specially crafted LLMNR query, containing a leading '.' character, an attacker\n        can trigger stack exhaustion or potentially cause stack memory corruption.\n\n        Although this vulnerability may lead to code execution, it has not been proven\n        to be possible at the time of this writing.\n\n        NOTE: In some circumstances, a '.' may be found before the top of the stack is\n        reached. In these cases, this module may not be able to cause a crash.",
