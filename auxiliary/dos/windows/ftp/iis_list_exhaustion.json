  "description": "This module triggers Denial of Service condition in the Microsoft Internet\n        Information Services (IIS) FTP Server 5.0 through 7.0 via a list (ls) -R command\n        containing a wildcard. For this exploit to work in most cases, you need 1) a valid\n        ftp account: either read-only or write-access account 2) the \"FTP Publishing\" must\n        be configured as \"manual\" mode in startup type 3) there must be at least one\n        directory under FTP root directory. If your provided an FTP account has write-access\n        privilege and there is no single directory, a new directory with random name will be\n        created prior to sending exploit payload.",
