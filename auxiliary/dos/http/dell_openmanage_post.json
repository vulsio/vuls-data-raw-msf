  "description": "This module exploits a heap overflow in the Dell OpenManage\n        Web Server (omws32.exe), versions 3.2-3.7.1. The vulnerability\n        exists due to a boundary error within the handling of POST requests,\n        where the application input is set to an overly long file name.\n        This module will crash the web server, however it is likely exploitable\n        under certain conditions.",
