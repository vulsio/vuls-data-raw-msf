	"description": "Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold them open as long as possible.\n        It accomplishes this by opening connections to the target web server and sending a partial request.\n        Periodically, it will send subsequent HTTP headers, adding to-but never completing-the request.\n        Affected servers will keep these connections open, filling their maximum concurrent connection pool,\n        eventually denying additional connection attempts from clients.",
