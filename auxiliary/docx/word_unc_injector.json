	"description": "This module modifies a .docx file that will, upon opening, submit stored\n        netNTLM credentials to a remote host. It can also create an empty docx file. If\n        emailed the receiver needs to put the document in editing mode before the remote\n        server will be contacted. Preview and read-only mode do not work. Verified to work\n        with Microsoft Word 2003, 2007, 2010, and 2013. In order to get the hashes the\n        auxiliary/server/capture/smb module can be used.",
