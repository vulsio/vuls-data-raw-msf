  "description": "This module can determine what public keys are configured for\n        key-based authentication across a range of machines, users, and\n        sets of known keys. The SSH protocol indicates whether a particular\n        key is accepted prior to the client performing the actual signed\n        authentication request. To use this module, a text file containing\n        one or more SSH keys should be provided. These can be private or\n        public, so long as no passphrase is set on the private keys.\n\n        If you have loaded a database plugin and connected to a database\n        this module will record authorized public keys and hosts so you can\n        track your process.\n\n        Key files may be a single public (unencrypted) key, or several public\n        keys concatenated together as an ASCII text file. Non-key data should be\n        silently ignored. Private keys will only utilize the public key component\n        stored within the key file.",
