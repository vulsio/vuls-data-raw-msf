	"description": "This module exploits an authentication bypass in libssh server code\n        where a USERAUTH_SUCCESS message is sent in place of the expected\n        USERAUTH_REQUEST message. libssh versions 0.6.0 through 0.7.5 and\n        0.8.0 through 0.8.3 are vulnerable.\n\n        Note that this module's success depends on whether the server code\n        can trigger the correct (shell/exec) callbacks despite only the state\n        machine's authenticated state being set.\n\n        Therefore, you may or may not get a shell if the server requires\n        additional code paths to be followed.",
