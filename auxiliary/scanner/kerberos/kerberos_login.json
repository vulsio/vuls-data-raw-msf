If you have loaded a database plugin\n          and connected to a database this module will record successful\n          logins and hosts so you can track your access.\n\n          Kerberos accounts which do not require pre-authentication will\n          have the TGT logged for offline cracking, this technique is known as AS-REP Roasting.\n\n          It is also able to identify whether user accounts are enabled or\n          disabled/locked out.",
