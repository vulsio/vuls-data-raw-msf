	"description": "This module identifies NTP servers which permit \"monlist\" queries and\n        obtains the recent clients list. The monlist feature allows remote\n        attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification)\n        via spoofed requests. The more clients there are in the list, the\n        greater the amplification.",
