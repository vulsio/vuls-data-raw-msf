	"description": "Crypto-NAK packets can be used to cause ntpd to accept time from\n          unauthenticated ephemeral symmetric peers by bypassing the\n          authentication required to mobilize peer associations.  This module\n          sends these Crypto-NAK packets in order to establish an association\n          between the target ntpd instance and the attacking client.  The end goal\n          is to cause ntpd to declare the legitimate peers \"false tickers\" and\n          choose the attacking clients as the preferred peers, allowing\n          these peers to control time.",
