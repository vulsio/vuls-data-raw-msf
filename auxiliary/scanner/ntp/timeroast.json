	"description": "Windows authenticates NTP requests by calculating the message digest using the NT hash followed by the first\n          48 bytes of the NTP message (all fields preceding the key ID). An attacker can abuse this to recover hashes\n          that can be cracked offline for machine and trust accounts. The attacker must know the accounts RID, but\n          because RIDs are sequential, they can easily be enumerated.",
