	"description": "Modbus is a cleartext protocol used in common SCADA systems, developed\n        originally as a serial-line (RS232) async protocol, and later transformed\n        to IP, which is called ModbusTCP. default tcp port is 502.\n\n        This module sends a command (0x04, read input register) to the modbus endpoint.\n        If this command is sent to the correct unit-id, it returns with the same function-id.\n        if not, it should be added 0x80, so that it sys 0x84, and an exception-code follows\n        which do not interest us. This does not always happen, but at least the first 4\n        bytes in the return-packet should be exact the same as what was sent.\n\n        You can change port, ip and the scan-range for unit-id. There is also added a\n        value - BENICE - to make the scanner sleep a second or more between probes. We\n        have seen installations where scanning too many too fast works like a DoS.",
