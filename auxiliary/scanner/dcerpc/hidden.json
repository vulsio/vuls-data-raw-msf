  "description": "This module will query the endpoint mapper and make a list\n      of all ncacn_tcp RPC services. It will then connect to each of\n      these services and use the management API to list all other\n      RPC services accessible on this port. Any RPC service found attached\n      to a TCP port, but not listed in the endpoint mapper, will be displayed\n      and analyzed to see whether anonymous access is permitted.",
