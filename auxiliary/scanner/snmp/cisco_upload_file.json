	"description": "This module will copy file to a Cisco IOS device using SNMP and TFTP.\n        The action Override_Config will override the running config of the Cisco device.\n        A read-write SNMP community is required. The SNMP community scanner module can\n        assist in identifying a read-write community. The target must\n        be able to connect back to the Metasploit system and the use of\n        NAT will cause the TFTP transfer to fail.",
