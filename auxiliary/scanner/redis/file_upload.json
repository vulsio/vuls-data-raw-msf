	"description": "This module can be used to leverage functionality exposed by Redis to\n          achieve somewhat arbitrary file upload to a file and directory to\n          which the user account running the redis instance has access.  It is\n          not totally arbitrary because the exact contents of the file cannot\n          be completely controlled given the nature of how Redis stores its\n          database on disk.",
