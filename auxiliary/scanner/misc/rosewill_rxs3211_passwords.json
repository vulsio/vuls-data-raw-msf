  "description": "This module takes advantage of a protocol design issue with the Rosewill admin\n        executable in order to retrieve passwords, allowing remote attackers to take\n        administrative control over the device.  Other similar IP Cameras such as Edimax,\n        Hawking, Zonet, etc, are also believed to have the same flaw, but not fully tested.\n        The protocol design issue also allows attackers to reset passwords on the device.",
