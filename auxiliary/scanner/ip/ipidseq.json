	"description": "This module will probe hosts' IPID sequences and classify\n        them using the same method Nmap uses when it's performing\n        its IPID Idle Scan (-sI) and OS Detection (-O).\n\n        Nmap's probes are SYN/ACKs while this module's are SYNs.\n        While this does not change the underlying functionality,\n        it does change the chance of whether or not the probe\n        will be stopped by a firewall.\n\n        Nmap's Idle Scan can use hosts whose IPID sequences are\n        classified as \"Incremental\" or \"Broken little-endian incremental\".",
