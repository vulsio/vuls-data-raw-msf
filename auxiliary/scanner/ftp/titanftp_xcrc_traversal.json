By making\n        sending multiple XCRC command, it is possible to disclose the contents of any\n        file on the drive with a simple CRC \"brute force\" attack.\n\n        Although the daemon runs with SYSTEM privileges, access is limited to files\n        that reside on the same drive as the FTP server's root directory.",
