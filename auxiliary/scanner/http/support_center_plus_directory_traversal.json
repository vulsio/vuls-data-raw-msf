  "description": "This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability found in ManageEngine\n        Support Center Plus build 7916 and lower. The module will create a support ticket\n        as a normal user, attaching a link to a file on the server. By requesting our\n        own attachment, it's possible to retrieve any file on the filesystem with the same\n        privileges as Support Center Plus is running. On Windows this is always with SYSTEM\n        privileges.",
