  "description": "This module attempts to login to GlassFish instance using username and password\n        combinations indicated by the USER_FILE, PASS_FILE, and USERPASS_FILE options.\n        It will also try to do an authentication bypass against older versions of GlassFish.\n        Note: by default, GlassFish 4.0 requires HTTPS, which means you must set the SSL option\n        to true, and SSLVersion to TLS1. It also needs Secure Admin to access the DAS remotely.",
