	"description": "This module attempts to authenticate to an AppleTV service with\n        the username, 'AirPlay'.  The device has two different access control\n        modes: OnScreen and Password. The difference between the two is the\n        password in OnScreen mode is numeric-only and four digits long, which\n        means when this option is enabled, this option, the module will make\n        sure to cover all of them - from 0000 to 9999.  The Password mode is\n        more complex, therefore the usual online bruteforce strategies apply.",
