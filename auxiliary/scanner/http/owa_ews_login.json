  "description": "This module attempts to log in to the Exchange Web Services, often\n        exposed at https://example.com/ews/, using NTLM authentication. This\n        method is faster and simpler than traditional form-based logins.\n\n        In most cases, all you need to set is RHOSTS and some combination of\n        user/pass files; the autodiscovery should find the location of the NTLM\n        authentication point as well as the AD domain, and use them accordingly.",
