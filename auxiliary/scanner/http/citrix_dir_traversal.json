	"description": "This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2019-19781) within Citrix ADC\n        (NetScaler). It requests the smb.conf file located in the /vpns/cfg directory by issuing the request\n        /vpn/../vpns/cfg/smb.conf. It then checks if the server is vulnerable by looking for the presence of\n        a \"[global]\" directive in smb.conf, which this file should always contain.",
