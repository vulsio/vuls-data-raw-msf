	"description": "This module attempts to enumerate users on the Synology NAS\n          by sending GET requests for the forgot password URL.\n          The Synology NAS will respond differently if a user is present or not.\n          These count as login attempts, and the default is 10 logins in 5min to\n          get a permanent block.  Set delay accordingly to avoid this, as default\n          is permanent.\n          Vulnerable DSMs are:\n          DSM 6.1 < 6.1.3-15152\n          DSM 6.0 < 6.0.3-8754-4\n          DSM 5.2 < 5.2-5967-04",
