	"description": "This module exploits a memory disclosure vulnerability in Elasticsearch\n          7.10.0 to 7.13.3 (inclusive). A user with the ability to submit arbitrary\n          queries to Elasticsearch can generate an error message containing previously\n          used portions of a data buffer.\n          This buffer could contain sensitive information such as Elasticsearch\n          documents or authentication details. This vulnerability's output is similar\n          to heartbleed.",
