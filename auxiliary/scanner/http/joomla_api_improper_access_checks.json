  "description": "Joomla versions between 4.0.0 and 4.2.7, inclusive, contain an improper API access vulnerability.\n          This vulnerability allows unauthenticated users access to webservice endpoints which contain\n          sensitive information. Specifically for this module we exploit the users and config/application\n          endpoints.\n\n          This module was tested against Joomla 4.2.7 running on Docker.",
