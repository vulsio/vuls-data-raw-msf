	"description": "This module uses John the Ripper or Hashcat to identify weak passwords that have been\n        acquired from unshadowed passwd files from Unix/Linux systems. The module will only crack\n        MD5, BSDi and DES implementations by default. However, it can also crack\n        Blowfish and SHA(256/512), but it is much slower.\n        MD5 is format 500 in hashcat.\n        DES is format 1500 in hashcat.\n        BSDI is format 12400 in hashcat.\n        BLOWFISH is format 3200 in hashcat.\n        SHA256 is format 7400 in hashcat.\n        SHA512 is format 1800 in hashcat.",
