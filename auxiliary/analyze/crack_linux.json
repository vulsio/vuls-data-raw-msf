	"description": "This module uses John the Ripper or Hashcat to identify weak passwords that have been\n        acquired from unshadowed passwd files from Unix/Linux systems. The module will only crack\n        MD5, BSDi and DES implementations by default. However, it can also crack\n        Blowfish and SHA(256/512), but it is much slower.",
