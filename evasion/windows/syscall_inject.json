  "description": "This module allows you to generate a Windows EXE that evades Host-based security products\n          such as EDR/AVs. It uses direct windows syscalls to achieve stealthiness, and avoid EDR hooking.\n\n          please try to use payloads that use a more secure transfer channel such as HTTPS or RC4\n          in order to avoid payload's network traffic getting caught by network defense mechanisms.\n          NOTE: for better evasion ratio, use high SLEEP values",
