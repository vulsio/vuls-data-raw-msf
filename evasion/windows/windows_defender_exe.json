Multiple techniques such as shellcode encryption, source code\n        obfuscation, Metasm, and anti-emulation are used to achieve this.\n\n        For best results, please try to use payloads that use a more secure channel\n        such as HTTPS or RC4 in order to avoid the payload network traffic getting\n        caught by antivirus better.",
